<li>We analyzed bank 23 (Huntington Banschares) and bank 24(Comerica Inc)&#39;s 500+ open job listings in their official careers websites by job functions. After scrape job postings from the websites, we organize it to CSV file with the specific informations, including job title, post date, job description, location and job type. According to the datasets from the companies, we compare it with the part 1&#39;s datasets and build an integrated format. Up to 02/09/2019, 40% of all banks&#39; jobs were in its technology division. The highest percentage of technology jobs were for analyst, followed by engineer and architect. 18% of all technology jobs at two companies were in its Engine Analyst, which was going building a next-generation decision engine for messaging to customers and prospects with one-to-one personalized marketing techniques. 24% of all technology jobs at Comerica Inc were principle engineer software, which mainly provide engineering and architecture support for complex system management activities.</li>
