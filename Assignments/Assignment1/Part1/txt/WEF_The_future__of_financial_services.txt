The Future of Financial Services

How disruptive innovations are reshaping the way financial 
services are structured, provisioned and consumed

An Industry Project of the Financial Services Community | Prepared in collaboration with Deloitte

Final Report ● June 2015

Forward

Consistent with the World Economic Forum’s mission of applying a multi-stakeholder approach 
to address issues of global impact, the creation of this report involved extensive outreach and 
dialogue with the financial services community, innovation community, academia and a large 
number of financial technology startups. The dialogue included numerous interviews and 
interactive sessions to discuss the insights and opportunities for collaborative action.

Sincere thanks are extended to the industry experts and emerging disruptors who contributed 
their unique insights to this report. In particular, the members of the Project’s Steering 
Committee and Working Group, who are introduced in the following pages, played an invaluable 
role as experts and patient mentors.

We are also very grateful for the generous commitment and support to Deloitte Consulting LLP 
in the U.S., an entity within the Deloitte1 network, in its capacity as the official professional 
services advisor to the World Economic Forum for this project.

Executive Summary

9

The mandate of this project was to explore the transformative potential of new 
entrants and innovations on business models in financial services

Project Context

We set out to address three major problems that have prevented a comprehensive understanding of the state of disruptive innovation in the industry:
 There is no common taxonomy or understanding of which innovations are the most relevant
 There is no clear understanding of the evolutionary path of emerging innovations
 The implications of those evolutions on incumbent business models are unclear, creating significant uncertainty for traditional players as they strive to 
react to growing competitive pressures

We structured our research around three main questions, each requiring distinct actions:

Project Approach

1

2

3

Which emerging innovations are the most impactful and relevant to the financial services industry?

Action: We identified 11 key clusters of innovations based on how they impact the core functions of financial services 

How will these innovations impact the ways in which financial services are structured, provisioned and consumed in the future?

Action: We considered a range of scenarios for the degree and nature of impact each cluster of innovation could have

What would be the implications of these changes on customers, financial institutions, and the overall financial services industry?

Action: We analysed  the implications of each scenario on customers, incumbent institutions and the overall financial services ecosystem

10

Over 15 months of research we engaged with industry leaders and innovators 
through interviews and multi-stakeholder workshops

Industry Leaders

 Oversight, guidance and thought leadership from 16 C-suite executives 

and 25 strategy officers of global financial institutions

 In-person and phone interviews with 100+ innovative new entrants

and subject matter experts

 Facilitated six multi-stakeholder workshops at global financial hubs with 300+ total participants including 
industry leaders, innovators, subject matter experts, and regulators

The outcome of this work is the first consolidated taxonomy for disruptive 
innovation in financial services 

Research Framework

We have structured our framework against six
functions of financial services and eleven clusters
of innovation.

Functions of Financial Services

Even in an environment of rapid change to the 
design, delivery and providers of financial services, 
the core needs those services fulfill remain the 
same. We have identified six core functions that 
comprise financial services :






Payments
Market 
Provisioning
Investment 
Management






Insurance
Deposits & 
Lending
Capital 
Raising

Clusters of Innovation

We have identified 11 clusters of innovation exerting 
pressure on traditional business models

We have synthesised six high level insights on innovation in financial services

Key Research Findings

Innovation in financial services is deliberate and predictable;

incumbent players are most likely to be attacked 

where the greatest sources of customer friction meet the largest profit pools

Innovations are having the greatest impact where they employ business models that are platform based, data 

intensive, and capital light 

The most imminent effects of disruption will be felt in the banking sector; however, the greatest impact of disruption 
is likely to be felt in the insurance sector

Incumbent institutions will employ parallel strategies; aggressively competing with new entrants while also 
leveraging legacy assets to provide those same new entrants with infrastructure and access to services 

Collaboration between regulators, incumbents and new entrants will be required to understand how new innovations 
alter the risk profile of the industry – positively and negatively

Disruption will not be a one-time event, rather a continuous pressure to innovate that will shape customer 

behaviours, business models, and the long-term structure of the financial services industry

13

In the following pages, we have summarised our insights by function and cluster

This section provides a summary of our findings, divided by function and clusters within the functions. For each cluster of innovation we have defined 
the major disruptive trends, summarized the impact, and examined key implications for institutions in that function and cluster.

Summary
The greatest potential for cryptocurrencies may be to radically 
streamline the transfer of value, rather than as store of value

Implications for Financial Institutions

Implications for Financial Institutions

 Financial institutions may lose control over their customers’ 
transaction experience as payments become more integrated

 As more efficient alternative rails are adopted, the role of traditional 
intermediaries as a trusted party may diminish 

 With reduced visibility, becoming the default card among specific 
customer segments will become critical

 Financial institutions may face a new set of risks (e.g., reputation, 
security) and regulatory issues as they participate in new rails

 Winning issuers will be able to gain visibility into more of 
customers’ spending patterns, build more holistic understanding 
of customers, and create more competitive offerings

 Applications of these technologies can expand beyond money 
transfer to modernise other financial infrastructures

Implications for Financial Institutions

Implications for Financial Institutions

 In an increasingly commoditised environment, the risks of 
customers being more fickle will increase and creating loyalty 
through innovation will become more important

 Insurers’ ability to benchmark against competitors will become 
more important as customers gain ability to comparison-shop

 With increased margin pressure, insurers will need to increase 
their size by expanding either scope or scale

 As customer relationships evolve from short-term product-based to 
long-term advisory, capturing customers early on becomes critical

 As insurers become a hub for customer data, their strategic value 
within full-service financial institutions will grow

 Forming partnerships with data providers, device manufacturers and 
other ecosystem participants will be critical to enable connected 
insurance

Summary
New entrants will make meeting customer demands more 

important, creating an imperative for banks to reconsider their 

roles

Implications for Financial Institutions

Implications for Financial Institutions

 Intensified competition will narrow spread between deposits and 
loans, decreasing financial institutions’ profitability

 Financial products will increasingly be offered on a stand-alone basis 
limiting incumbents’ ability to competitively cross-subsidise

 As savers turn to alternative platforms, traditional deposits and 
investment products will be eroded

 Financial institutions’ ability to collaborate with non-traditional 
players and other institutions will become essential

 Distribution of customers’ credit portfolio over a large number of 
alternative platforms may make it difficult to measure customer’s 
creditworthiness

 Financial institutions will need to choose where they will specialise 
and where they will leverage external partners (e.g., product 
manufacturing vs. creation of customer experience)

Summary

Crowdfunding platforms are widening access to capital raising 

activities, making the overall ecosystem richer

Implications for Financial Institutions

 Access to more diverse funding options allow new companies to 
grow at a quicker pace and shorten the average time between 
early funding stages

 Distribution platforms create a venue for investors to tailor their 
investment portfolio across dimensions beyond financial return

 As the barriers to enter the asset class fall, it becomes ever more 
important for traditional intermediaries’ profitability to find 
undiscovered “start” investments

Implications for Financial Institutions

Implications for Financial Institutions

 New entrants will place pressure on margins and intensify 
competition among traditional players in more specialised 
segments 

 The ability to access sophisticated capabilities without large 
infrastructure investments flattens the playing field for mid-sized 
institutions

 As more advisory functions become automated, distributing 
wealth products via proprietary advisory channels will become 
less effective

 As new entrants widen the access for mass customers, they will 
compete for customers’ traditional savings deposits

 Organisational agility will become critical to sustain competitiveness 
as high-value capabilities are continued to be commoditised

 Externalisation of capabilities may result in workforce skill loss by 
preventing the development of a holistic view of operations

Summary

As the popularity of high frequency trading declines, the focus of 

algorithmic trading may shift to smarter, faster response to real-
life events

Summary
New information platforms are improving connectivity among 

market constituents, making the markets more liquid, accessible, 

and efficient

Implications for Financial Institutions

Implications for Financial Institutions

 The impacts of event-driven algorithmic trading on liquidity, 
spread and systemic stability are unclear

 With end-to-end trading activities automated, even small errors in 
data integrity, trade strategy, and execution will lead to large 
impacts 

 Regulators have the potential to significantly alter the course of 
developments in this area

 As traditional differentiators among intermediaries (e.g., ability to 
discover counterparty) become commoditised, the importance of 
advisory services will increase

 Information platforms will evolve the standards for best-execution 
from a best-efforts basis to more quantifiable and comparable 
metrics

20

We identified six important themes that cut across functions and touch multiple 
clusters of innovation

1

Streamlined Infrastructure

 Emerging platforms and decentralised technologies provide new ways to 
aggregate and analyse information, improving connectivity and reducing the 
marginal costs of accessing information and participating in financial activities

2

Automation of High-Value Activities

 Many emerging innovations leverage advanced algorithms and computing 
power to automate activities that were once highly manual, allowing them to 
offer cheaper, faster, and more scalable alternative products and services

3

Reduced Intermediation

 Emerging innovations are streamlining or eliminating traditional institutions’ 
role as intermediaries, and offering lower prices and / or higher returns to 
customers

4

The Strategic Role of Data

 Emerging innovations allow financial institutions to access new data sets, such 
as social data, that enable new ways of understanding customers and markets

5

Niche, Specialised Products

 New entrants with deep specialisations are creating highly targeted products 
and services, increasing competition in these areas and creating pressure for 
the traditional end-to-end financial services model to unbundle

6

Customer Empowerment

 Emerging innovations give customers access to previously restricted assets 
and services, more visibility into products, and control over choices, as well as 
the tools to become “prosumers”

At the conclusion of the research phase, the Steering Committee gave us a 
mandate to dive more deeply into high-potential areas of disruption

Next Steps

We have identified three major challenge areas related to innovation in financial services that will require multi-stakeholder collaboration to be 
addressed effectively. We are launching a project stream related to each area, with the goal of enabling tangible impact.

The Forum is uniquely positioned to support advancements against each challenge due to its ability to:
 Convene senior multi-stakeholder groups and align diverse perspectives
 Create thought leadership on cutting-edge issues with long-term implications to the industry

Challenges

Projects

New financial products and services are creating significant regulatory 
uncertainty and fueling perceptions of regulatory arbitrage

Regulatory Models 
for Innovation

Decentralised systems, such as the blockchain protocol, threaten to 
disintermediate almost every process in financial services

Applications of 
Decentralised Systems

Outdated identity management protocols create risks and 
inefficiencies for both service providers and consumers

Blueprint for 
Digital Identity

We will be presenting outcomes from these projects in early 2016

How will customer needs and 
behaviours change in an increasingly 
cashless payments landscape?

27

Payments: Cashless World

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 A number of innovations have emerged in the past five years leveraging mobile devices and connectivity to make payments simpler and more 
valuable. Examples range from digital wallets to automated machine-to-machine payments
 The majority of these innovations will modify front-end processes to improve the customer and merchant experience while leaving the underlying 
payments infrastructure undisrupted

Future of Payments

 These innovations will reduce the use of cash and make payments less visible to payers. They will also enable financial institutions and merchants 
to use data-driven customer engagement platforms
‒ As more payment solutions allow customers to link their bank accounts for direct payment and seamless point-of-sale vendor financing, the use 
of credit cards could be displaced by these platforms
‒ Customers may lose visibility into their payment choices, increasing their default cards’ share of wallet and reducing the importance of some 
traditional differentiators like brand and design
‒ The elimination of a need to carry physical cards and the emergence of payment decision support systems could support the proliferation of 
niche and merchant issued cards, splintering wallet share among many cards 

Key Implications

 Success of any innovative payment solution will require a strong customer rationale to switch, as most customers do not consider the existing 
payment regime to be broken 
 In an increasingly cashless future payment providers who can embrace emerging payment innovations to offer differentiated, value-adding digital 
experiences will be able to deepen their relationships with customers and take a dominant place in the changing market landscape

Payments: Cashless World

The payments industry has continuously evolved over time, but there are still 
some challenges to make the world cashless

 Since the introduction of credit cards in the 1950s, debit cards in the 1980s and the rise of e-commerce through the 1990s, electronic payments have 
grown in popularity, displacing cash and cheques. In 2012 they accounted for 68 percent of U.S. transactions in value

History of the payments industry

 Electronic transactions rely on a number of intermediaries, which provide acceptance, convenience and security of transactions, and are generally 
coordinated by large scale-based payment networks

Benefits of electronic transactions

Key challenges inhibiting the cashless world

 Convenience: Reduces the need for customers and merchants to 
carry cash, reducing associated costs, including trips to banks, price 
inflexibility and opportunity costs (i.e., interest earned)
 Efficiency: Reduces the cash management costs for businesses and 
financial institutions as fewer bills are exchanged by hand and money 
movements are settled electronically
 Traceability: Enables a greater degree of visibility into the flow of 
money for financial institutions and regulators, facilitating taxation, 
transparency, and information gathering
 Protection: Protects customers and merchants from fraud and theft by 
documenting transaction records and reducing the need to hold cash

Merchant Adoption

Electronic payments are not 
accepted by every merchant due 
to the infrastructure costs, high 
fees and settlement delays

Convenience

Small denomination payments are 
often still conducted reducing the 
number of processing steps and 
time to complete a transaction

Accessibility

Under-banked population does 
not have access to primary 
accounts and therefore only uses 
cash in transactions

Fraud

Despite the safety measures 
increasingly adopted, electronic 
transactions create opportunities 
for fraudulent activities

Payments: Cashless World

Innovations will make payments more cashless and invisible in the future, while 
enabling data-driven engagement platforms for customers

Key characteristics of the future of payments

Cashless

Back of Mind

More cash will be displaced by electronic 
transactions as payments innovations make it 
beneficial for customers to use payment cards 
even in small denomination transactions

As more transactions become virtual and 
automated, more payments processes will 
become invisible to end customers, changing 
their needs and behaviours

Engagement

As payments and mobility becomes more 
integrated, the importance of payment 
transactions as a potential customer interaction 
point will increase for merchants and financial 
institutions

Data-Driven

With greater adoption of electronic payments, 
more data will be accumulated from payment 
transactions, allowing financial institutions, 
services providers and merchants to gain 
greater understanding of customers and 
businesses

Increased Access to Loans

As more payments are processed through 
electronic rails, financial institutions’ visibility 
into individuals’ and businesses’ cashflow and 
spending patterns will increase, improving their 
ability to extend loans to customers previously 
less understood

Reduced Costs

Because innovative solutions build on the 
existing infrastructure, which has very low 
variable costs, the cost of making electronic 
transactions will fall as electronic payments 
gain more volume

As innovations change customer behaviours by making payments more effortless and provide 
financial institutions and merchants with data, what will be the payments landscape in the future?

Key change to payment  behaviour

 Customers lose visibility into their payment 
choices as innovations like Amazon’s 1-
click and Uber’s seamless payments push 
more and more transactions to a single 

default card

 The default cards’ share of wallet will 
increase and the importance of 
differentiators like card brand and design 
will be reduced

 The successful deployment of digital wallets 
eliminates the need to own/carry physical 
cards and enable decision support systems 

to help customers optimise card usage
 This drives a proliferation of niche and 
merchant issued cards, splintering share 

of wallet across many providers

 Customers with revolving balances elect to 

use innovative point of sale vendor 

financing schemes offering preferable 
terms

 Credit card usage is eroded as 

transactional card users migrate to payment 

solutions that seamlessly link to their 
bank accounts 

 The following scenarios illustrate potential outcomes generated by the innovations discussed in this topic, particularly in response to the key 
question above – they are not meant to be future predictions
 These scenarios are illustrations of particular aspects of the potential future and are not meant to represent a complete view of the market and

Narrative

Summary of impact

To avoid “moments of truth” in customer decision-making, more 
merchants and payment solutions will adopt an automated or one-click / 
one-touch / one- tap check-out in both virtual and physical marketplaces. 
These “seamless” check-out environments will rely on a default card that 
will be used unless customers make a conscious choice to change cards. 
As a result, default cards will become significantly stickier and receive a 
higher share of total customer spend.
Card issuers will respond to the changing landscape by developing 
products that provide the best loyalty points and benefits in aggregate to 
compete for the role of the default card.

 Customers lose the desire to regularly use a variety of cards as 
payment innovations enable a seamless transaction experience in one-
click / one-touch or less 
 Driven by simplicity and convenience, customers push more 
transactions to a single default card, increasing the default card’s share 
of wallet
 As customers’ desire to switch cards decreases, traditional 
differentiators like card brand and design may become less prominent, 
making it more difficult for card issuers to differentiate

Case studies

Order Ahead

In-app purchases within mobile apps can turn traditional physical 
purchases into online purchases and combine purchase and 
payment into a single tap, eliminating the step for payment method 
selection

Virtual payment processing services store customers’ payment 
credentials and allow customers to use those credentials in one-click 
or tap to maximise convenience and improve security

Narrative

Summary of impact

The adoption of digital wallets will free consumers from physical limitations 
on the number of cards they can carry, allowing niche cards to gain 
popularity, particularly in geographies where customers are value-
conscious. 
This proliferation of cards will encourage the development of decision 
support systems that interact with digital wallets to help customers choose 
the best card for each purchase. As a result, owning and using multiple 
payment cards will no longer hinder the delivery of a seamless customer 
experience, prompting further proliferation of niche / merchant-issued 
cards.

 The successful deployment of digital wallets eliminates the need to 
carry physical cards and virtually removes the limitations on the 
number of payment cards customers can carry and use
 Proliferation of digital wallets also enables decision support systems to 
help customers optimise card usage by automating card selection 
based on loyalty points and other benefits
 This drives a proliferation of niche and merchant-branded cards, 
optimised for specific purchases, splintering share of wallet across 
many providers

Case studies

Currently, customers can add multiple payments cards (credit and 
debit) to leading digital wallets (e.g., 8 for Apple Pay, unlimited for 
Google Wallet), and pick and choose a payment card for each 
transaction with few additional clicks / taps

While currently not integrated with digital wallets, decision support 
systems run on mobile and wearable devices to automatically 
recommend the optimal payment option among payment cards 
added by the customers to maximise the overall rewards

36

Scenario 2: Fragmentation of the payment market (2 / 2)

Necessary conditions for the scenario

Implications of the scenario on…

 Merchants’ widespread acceptance of smart payment solutions or the 
solutions’ successful integration with existing acceptance markets
 Development of payment solutions into platforms surrounded by 
innovative ecosystems (e.g., increased linkage between mobile wallets 
and merchant apps, location-based check-out experience creation)
 Proven efficiency and impartiality of recommendations engines’ card 
choice for each transactions, creation of streamlined user experience 
and differentiated value propositions by smart wallets that will drive 
consumers to want to adopt the optimisation services

Incumbents

 Able to optimise reward collection without sacrificing 
seamless experience
 Potential increase in debt as it becomes easier to 
issue multiple credit cards, offset by spending

 Potential decrease in total merchant service charges 
paid as private-label cards are more widely adopted 
among each merchant’s customer base

 Increased issuance of a greater variety of cards
 Increased competition from new entrants, including 
merchant credit cards
 Stronger competitive position for niche players

Overall

 Encourage issuers to improve and innovate their 
product offerings (e.g., rewards programmes, interest 
rates)

 Potential decline in the efficacy of rewards programmes if card is only 
used for most rewarding (lowest margin) transactions

Narrative

Summary of impact

Today, merchants and payment solutions providers, such as mobile wallets 
pay higher merchant service charges on credit card-funded transactions 
than on bank account-funded transactions. To reduce costs, these players 
will use incentives to encourage customers to switch their funding method 
from credit cards to bank accounts. At the same time, merchants will adopt 
data-driven alternative vendor financing solutions that offer customers 
lower interest rates and provide financing income to merchants. 
These innovations will place pressure on credit card transaction volume 
and interest income; limiting issuers’ ability to offer attractive loyalty 
programmes and reducing competitiveness in the face of merchants who 
are able to directly offer their own incentives (e.g., loyalty points, special 
offers).

Case studies

 Credit card usage is eroded on two fronts: payment facilitation and 
revolving lending / loyalty
 Payment solutions that link directly to bank accounts provide an 
alternative to customers who previously relied on credit cards for 
payment facilitation
 Point-of-sale vendor financing schemes and merchant loyalty 
functionalities within new payment solutions further their appeal to 
customers who currently rely on credit cards for revolving balances or 
loyalty accumulation

Leading mobile payment solutions allow 
customers to fund their purchases with credit 
cards and bank accounts and generally earn 
profits only on bank-funded transactions

Leading mobile payment platforms allow 
customers to add, manage and use multiple 
merchant loyalty programmes and enable 
merchants to directly issue offers to customers

Emerging point-of-sale vendor financing 
schemes provide revolving or purchase-
specific line of credit to replace the need for 
credit card financing

38

Payments: Cashless World

Scenario 3: Displacement of credit cards (2/3)

Necessary conditions for the scenario

Implications of the scenario on…

 Create incentives for customers to switch their funding methods
‒ Merchants’ willingness to transfer financial incentives to customers 
to be more appealing than the rewards offered by card issuers
‒ Sufficient trust needs to build with wallet providers, alternative 
lending providers and loyalty providers
 Development of alternative financing providers that can offer 
comparable user experience and efficiency as credit cards (e.g., 
seamless application process at POS and efficient loan servicing) 
 Cooperation of bank account providers and payment solution providers 
to allow a seamless connection of payment vehicle and account, 
including sufficient data visibility for real-time decisioning and 
authorisation
 Clearly defined liability rules across all ecosystem participants and 
payment solutions’ ability to provide zero liability for consumers while 
offering higher rewards
 Bank account providers’ willingness to take on credit risk
 Fraud monitoring that maintains fraud levels near those of the current 
payment networks
 Development of wallet solutions and business models that do not 
impose large adoption costs to merchants and have a strong business 
case
 Acceptance infrastructure of providers must be ubiquitous enough to 
build customer use patterns

Customers

Merchants

 Shift in financial incentives from card-driven rewards 
programmes to direct savings from merchants
 Potential savings from lower transaction fees if bank 
account / wallet providers can adopt security 
innovations and offer protection at a lower cost than 
current credit card fees

 Cost reduction due to elimination of credit card fees, 
potentially offset by passing on savings to customers 
and increased fraud costs
 Exert greater control in the payments ecosystem

Incumbents

 Reduced fee revenues
 Transaction accounts become more important than 
credit cards in customer retention

Overall

 Increased risk of violations against data protection and security of 
transactions due to replacement of proven credit card infrastructure 
with immature alternative payment solutions
 Lack of clear liability construct could drive confusion across participants
 De-centralisation of payment transactions could drive increased fraud 
and lower efficacy than existing models

How will the evolution of 
decentralised or non-traditional 
payment schemes change the role of 
traditional financial institutions? 

42

Payments: Decentralised and Non-Traditional Payment Schemes

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 The current value transfer system, built on automated clearing houses and intermediary banks, has made it easier for customers to send money 
across geographies, but many pain points remain to enabling rapid and inexpensive value transfer between countries
 Decentralised currencies and mobile money solutions provide compelling alternatives to traditional value transferring systems by streamlining the 
intermediating processes

Future of Payment and Settlement Rails

 Driven by competitive pressure from these innovations, the future of value transfer will be more global, faster, more transparent, and cheaper
‒ These non-traditional schemes may compete directly with the existing financial ecosystem as alternative payment networks emerge along with a 
variety of financial products denominated in network’s native currency
‒ Financial institutions may choose to facilitate the growth of alternative payment networks as a complement to existing networks. They might act 
as a gateway for value into these networks and launch financial products that are connected to non-traditional payment schemes
‒ Alternatively, the non-traditional schemes may act as a catalyst for traditional institutions to develop solutions that fix key pain points in the 
current value transfer system; potentially by leveraging elements of the non-traditional schemes

Key Implications

 To bring innovations to the traditional value transfer rails, financial institutions must collaborate to identify top priority areas for transformation solve 
for regulatory complexity

43

Payments: Decentralised and Non-Traditional Payment Schemes

While the rails built on automated clearing houses have enabled value transfer 
across geographies, many pain points are emerging as customer expectations rise

How do financial institutions facilitate value transfer today?

 While the current “rails” for value transfer between financial institutions are complex and involve many institutions a similar process is used for all 
transactions; from large institutional transfers to the settlement of retail payments

Evolution of money transfer schemes

Key pain points with today’s schemes

 The basic elements of the current value transfer process have been in 
place for over 150 years
 The concept of “wire transfers” was originated by telegraph companies 
(e.g., Western Union) who would receive funds for transfer from a 
sending party and send a telegraph to correspondent branch instructing 
them to deliver the money to the intended recipient
 The digitisation of this process throughout the latter half of the 20th
century improved the security of messaging services and improved the 
settlement time of clearing house activities

 The actual transfer is not instantaneous: funds may take several hours 
or even days to move from the sender's account to the receiver's 
account
 If the sending and recipient banks do not hold reciprocal accounts the 
payment must be sent to a clearing house or correspondent bank for 
the assurance of payment for the recipient, adding costs and delays 
 The complex structure of requesting the recipient bank to demand 
payment makes the process more vulnerable to fraud using exposed 
sender credentials

44

Payments: Decentralised and Non-Traditional Payment Schemes

Decentralised payment schemes leverage cryptographic protocols to transfer 
value virtually in a secure, low cost, near-instantaneous manner

What are decentralised payment schemes?

 Decentralised networks utilise a common set of protocols to allocate 
tasks across many individual nodes rather than via a central point
 Email is an example of a decentralised system that uses a common 
protocol (SMTP) to distribute mail between a vast number of servers
 Decentralised payment systems allow users to transmit value between 
users, typically secured by a set of cryptographic processes
 Most decentralised payment schemes use a single distributed ledger 
and denominate payments between users in a native “currency,” often 
referred to as a “crypto-currency” 

Illustrative Distributed Payment Network

Decentralised System / Ledger

How have decentralised schemes developed?

What are some emerging decentralised schemes?

 Digital payment schemes are as old as the internet itself with many 
notable failures including Beenz, Flooz, and Digicash, and the most 
notable success being PayPal. However, all of these schemes utilised 
a centralised network requiring trust by users in a central counterparty
 In 2009 a pseudonymous whitepaper proposed the creation of a 
distributed ledger where transactions between participants could be 
processed in a trustless environment via a cryptographic process
 The implementation of this distributed payment protocol is the Bitcoin 
network and the native currency of the ledger are Bitcoins
 Since 2009 a range of service providers have emerged to support the 
acceptance of payments via the Bitcoin network
 At the same time, many competing schemes have launched, built on 
the same underlying concepts but employing different encryption 
technology or focusing on different use cases

current systems but user identification may be weaker or nonexistent

45

Payments: Decentralised and Non-Traditional Payment Schemes

Mobile monies and P2P value transfer networks rely on a trusted central party to 
transfer value rapidly across geographies, even in underbanked regions

What are non-traditional payment schemes?

 Mobile money refers to a network that supports payment from one user 
to another via a mobile device
 A mobile money service may be launched by any firm, not just a 
traditional financial institution. Mobile money services have been 
launched by network operators (MPESA) and online retailers (PayPal)
 Transactions may be denominated in a fiat currency or in a form of 
value issued by the central intermediary 
 In developing countries mobile payment solutions have been deployed 
to extend financial services to the "unbanked" or "underbanked“

How have non-traditional schemes developed?

What are some emerging non-traditional schemes?

 In 2002, researchers noted that individuals in Uganda, Botswana and 
Ghana were spontaneously using airtime as a proxy for money 
transfer; transferring airtime to their relatives or friends who would then 
use or resell it
 In April 2007, Kenya’s dominant mobile network operator, Safaricom, 
launched a new mobile phone-based payment and money transfer 
service, M-Pesa allowing users to deposit money into an account that 
can be accessed on their cell phones and send balances using SMS
 In January 2011, Transferwise launched a P2P cross-border money 
transfer service to aggregate and facilitate exchange of foreign 
currency and transfer needs at the interbank rate

Characteristics of non-traditional schemes

 Transactions are completed rapidly and are highly transparent to both 
senders and recipients
 Transfer costs are very low and fees are highly transparent
 Many schemes are moving towards open systems, as they build in 
interoperability with other schemes and traditional outlets (e.g., ATM)
 Does not necessarily require a traditional bank account or well 
established financial infrastructure making them well suited for financial 
inclusion goals

46

Payments: Decentralised and Non-Traditional Payment Schemes

 Prone to fraud when the sender’s 
credentials are exposed
 Transfer can take days and efficiency 
varies by countries / institutions
 High costs / number of intermediaries

 Value transfer is recorded in a 
distributed ledger 
 Transactions are managed by a 
distributed network of processors
 Sender initiates the transfer

 Value transfer is facilitated by a 
single trusted non-financial 3rd party
 Relies on the intermediary to keep 
records and settle the transfer
 Sender initiates the transfer

 Transfer history is transparent, 
traceable and practically unalterable
 Lower direct costs of transaction due 
to distribution across the network
 Lower exposure to conventional fraud
 Settlement is near real-time; no 
counterparty risk

 High volatility in the value of the 
native “currency”
 Regulatory scrutiny creates 
challenges to connecting with fiat 
currency ecosystems 
 Anonymity of accounts / irreversibility 
of transfers creates security issues
 Higher exposure to unconventional 
fraud (e.g., large-scale hacking)

 Simpler and cheaper transfers
 Improved user transparency
 Enables rapid or real-time settlement
 The reach of the intermediary may 
exceed that of financial institutions, 
particularly in developing countries

 Scalability is dependent on the 
availability / adoption of the 
intermediary platform
 Cross border flows of funds can 
create regulatory challenges

Payments: Decentralised and Non-Traditional Payment Schemes

These emerging non-traditional payment schemes will create competitive pressure 
for the value transfer rails to become faster, cheaper and more borderless

Key characteristics of the future value transfer systems

Global

Geographical distance as a factor in 
transferring value will continue to narrow and 
even under-banked regions will be connected

Fast

Transparent

The time it takes to transfer value between 
two accounts will be significantly reduced

The flow of funds will become increasingly 
visible and traceable

Secure

The opportunities for fraudulent activities will 
be largely reduced

Reduced Costs

The cost to execute transfers will be 
minimised with the streamlined and 
automated rails

In achieving these future state characteristics, how will the evolution of decentralised or non-
traditional payment schemes change the role of traditional financial institutions?

With new start-ups providing protection against fraud and fluctuation in 
value, decentralised schemes (e.g., Bitcoin) gain momentum as a set of 
rails to transfer value between individuals. In less developed countries, 
alternative payment schemes (e.g., M-Pesa) become the dominant 
solution for the under-banked population. 
New entrants emerge to manufacture and distribute financial products with 
a compelling value proposition (e.g., savings accounts, insurance policies, 
merchant solutions) denominated in the native currencies of these 
alternative payment networks. As the result, customers no longer need to 
transfer money out of the scheme to consume these products, further 
reinforcing the network.

Summary of impact

As the popularity of decentralised and other non-traditional payment 
schemes grows within customer segments, incumbent institutions make it 
easier for their customers to transfer value into and out of the alternative 
rails. Gradually, these institutions leverage their current products and 
capabilities to begin playing a greater role as a gateway to non-traditional 
payment networks rails and financial products denominated in alternative 
currencies (e.g., a Bitcoin denominated bank account).
Alternatively, incumbent institutions could adopt non-traditional schemes 
as an internal settlement rail to improve efficiency and customer 
experience. Once these rails are in place, it would be easier for financial 
institutions to offer products for non-traditional schemes.

 Traditional institutions launch financial products that are connected to 
alternative payment scheme ecosystems (e.g., Bitcoin savings 
accounts, mobile money insurance)
 Financial institutions may also act as a gateway to alternative payment 
schemes (e.g., authentication)
 Traditional institutions are involved in both alternative payment 
schemes and traditional rails and in some cases, act as points of 
interaction

Case studies

Fidor, an online full-service bank, has adopted the Ripple protocol for 
all internal settlement processes to improve efficiency. If usage of the 
Ripple protocol were to expand to other banks, it could be easily used 
for real-time payment and settlement between these institutions with 
no automated clearing house or correspondent banks required.

CIC, a traditional insurer, launched micro-insurance products (e.g., 
funeral insurance) that accept payment, and pay out claims in M-Pesa 
balances to target the under-banked population. These products allow 
CIC to build loyalty and brand recognition with a future customer base.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Increasingly perceiving alternative payment schemes as a threat, 
traditional financial institutions have intensified efforts to transform their 
payment and settlement rails. Financial institutions may make major 
upgrades to existing payment and settlement systems or build on top of 
them, employing existing or proprietary message sets. Alternatively, 
financial institutions may leverage innovations developed by alterative 
payment networks (such as the block chain) to achieve these goals but 
elect to stop short of using the alternative networks themselves.
As transferring value within the existing financial ecosystem becomes 
cheaper, faster, more transparent and more global, the incentives for 
customers to use payment rails from non-traditional providers will 
decrease in the face of uncertainties associated with these options.

 Alternative payment schemes act as a catalyst for traditional 
institutions to develop new solutions
 Leveraging elements of alternative schemes, traditional institutions 
build more streamlined rail for the movement of money 
 These solutions reduce the advantages of alternative payment 
schemes and retain the flow of money within the traditional financial 
network
 As a result, alternative payment schemes do not reach maturity and 
cease to be a serious threat of disintermediation

Case studies

A number of national retail financial institutions launched consortiums to provide a P2P money transfer 
service to their customers. While some of these services still rely on traditional settlement rails, adoption of 
more streamlined technologies and processes can improve these transfers making them lower cost and 
near-real-time.

57

Insurance: Disaggregation of Value Chain

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 A number of emerging forces are creating pressure across the insurance value chain, with the potential to redefine the structure of the market
 The rise of online aggregators and the potential entry of technology players could disaggregate the distribution of personal and small commercial 
policies and separate insurers from the ownership of customer relationships 
 The development of autonomous vehicles and advanced sensors will inherently reduce risk with home and auto while the proliferation of sharing 
economies will homogenize risks. These and other forces are standardising and commoditising individual risks

Future of Insurance Value Chain 

 New sources of capital and investment management capabilities, such as hedge funds and investment banks, are aggressively moving in to the 
insurance industry through innovative securitisation products, offering more cost-effective options to fund policies
‒ As the insurance value chain is disaggregated and commoditised, the importance of scale as a source of efficiency may increase, leading to 
market consolidation
‒ Increased use of commoditised personal insurance products in cross sell, along with blurring lines of property ownership, may support the rise of 
extremely broad multi-line policies
‒ Disaggregation of the mass personal lines market may also lead to insurers shifting their focus to niche and commercial markets where 
traditional capabilities like actuarial skill, underwriting and personal relationships can make bigger differences to performance

Key Implications

 In order to remain competitive in the face of a disaggregating value chain insurers will need to reconsider which core competencies they will invest 
in to maintain a strong competitive position

58

Insurance: Disaggregation of Value Chain

The industry has been slowly evolving over the past couple decades, adopting 
customer centric innovations from other financial services functions 

What are the core capabilities of insurers today?

 Insurance is typically considered one of the functions within financial services where the adoption of innovation has been the slowest

 However, over the past decade many innovative practices such as digital channels and process automation have been gradually adopted by many 
insurers. This has been especially true in personal lines of business while large commercial lines have continued to focus on establishing a “personal 
touch” across the value chain

 Traditional broker / agent in-person distribution faces 
significant competitive pressures from digital channels 
in personal lines
 Distribution partnerships with banks and retailers 
through white-labelling and over-the-counter products 
have become increasingly popular

 In some geographies, customer-centric high-touch services 
have emerged to provide differentiated claims experience 
(e.g., rapid response teams) 
 The adoption of digital channels has begun to replace manual 
time-consuming processes to empower customers and / or 
workforce

Insurance: Disaggregation of Value Chain

A number of emerging forces will lead to pressure on the insurance industry 
across the value chain (1 / 2)

Advancing technologies, changing customer preferences and the market landscape are enabling a number of innovations and trends, which create 
pressure across the insurance value chain 

Key pressures across the insurance value chain

e-Aggregators

Online aggregators that allow customers to 
compare prices and purchase insurance 
products online may displace traditional 
distribution channels as customer 
preferences change and more insurance 
products are commoditised (e.g., UK P&C 
market)

Entry of tech players

Technology providers with brand 
recognition and trust surpassing financial 
institutions may enter the insurance 
distribution market, leveraging their 
extensive data and distribution capability. 
Google acquired a UK e-aggregator 
BeatThatQuote charging insurers up to $54

Fully or partially self-driving cars are 
emerging leveraging smart sensors,

drivers to manufacturers

Sharing economy

As sharing economies emerge from pay-as-
you-go rentals to shared vehicles and 
houses, the concept of ownership may 
radically change, challenging traditional 
insurance models developed based on one-
to-one ownership structure

Entry of hedge funds

Driven by a low interest rate environment 
and access to premiums, hedge funds and 
alternative sources of capital are moving 
closer to the insurance value chain by 
setting up reinsurers, providing additional 
funding options for insurers

Decoupling of Capital

e-Aggregators and technology providers could 
disaggregate the distribution of personal and

As properties (home and auto) become safer 
and sharing economy homogenises risks, 
individual risks will be increasingly standardised 
and commoditised 

A larger proportion of investment risks will be 
transferred outside of an insurance company as 
more alternative providers of capital (e.g., hedge 
funds) offer cost-effective options

 Customer loyalty to insurers will decrease 
as aggregators create distance between the 
individual and their insurer
 Erosion will occur in the competitive 
advantages from existing retail channels 
(e.g., agent force, brand)

 The importance of actuarial and 
underwriting capabilities will grow as other 
parts of the value chain are disaggregated
 Insurers’ margins on personal and small 
commercial products will decrease 

 Growth of insurers will be less constrained

Narrative

Summary of impact

As a homogenisation of risk profiles leads to margin pressures and a price 
sensitive market (particularly in more commoditised segments such as 
personal auto) insurers who can achieve economies of scale will be able 
to provide lower prices and gain market share. In order to gain scale, M&A 
activities among insurers will proliferate and insurers will partner with non-
traditional companies, such as technology platforms, to distribute their 
products. This will allow customers to compare prices and products more 
readily and accelerate commoditisation of the market. Insurers may also 
actively reinsure their businesses using securitisation and alternative 
capital sources to minimise regulatory burdens and stablise their margins.

 With increasingly homogenised risk profiles and commoditised 
personal insurance policies, the importance of scale to drive efficiency 
will grow, leading to the market consolidation
 Disaggregation of distribution to technology platforms will enable 
insurers to scale rapidly in a cost-effective manner
 Widened access to capital through securitisation and hedge funds will 
generate excess underwriting capacity for insurers to support rapid 
growth and consolidation

Case studies

Increased transparency via online channels and limited investment returns have put significant pressure on pricing in 
the US auto insurance industry, driving a rapid consolidation over the past 10 years. Even absent notable M&A 
activities, large insurers who can afford big marketing and R&D budgets have grown rapidly; leveraging their 
superior customer acquisition capabilities and a price advantage derived from economies of scale. As a result, the 
share of top 10 auto insurers in the United States has grown from 59% in 2000 to 71% in 2012.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Today insurers frequently cross sell commoditised, low margin products 
with their higher margin peers (e.g., the bundling of low margin auto 
insurance with higher margin home insurance). As the commoditisation of 
risks accelerates across various products, multi-line insurers may focus 
more heavily on bundling and cross selling products to achieve economies 
of scale and build customer loyalty. 
Leveraging the more granular and individualised data available through 
connected devices, insurers may ultimately be able to take product cross 
selling to its logical extreme; offering a single insurance policy covering all 
(or a very wide range) of an individual’s risks.

 Personal insurance products that are commoditised in the future will be 
increasingly used as a bundle to cross sell other more profitable 
products
 As the concept of property ownership blurs in the sharing economy, the 
concept of cross sell may expand so that an insurance policy 
encompasses all risks associated with the customer, rather than risks 
associated with specific assets
 Through increased connectivity, the “personal” insurance policies may 
be adjusted more frequently to add, subtract or modify coverages to 
match the customers’ individual usage patterns

Case studies

Farm Family has introduced the concept  of aggregate flexible contract to small / medium enterprises , concentrating on 
rural and suburban area, and targeting specific risks surrounding certain sectors (e.g., Special Farm Package 10 for 
agriculture owners). On the personal insurance side, many multi-line insurers offer bundling discounts to customers to 
promote cross sell across personal auto, home and life policies, with auto and home cross sell being more popular among 
customers, yet multi-line contracts are still not widely adopted.

Summary of impact

 Disaggregation of the personal lines value chain may lead some 
insurers to shift their focus to niche markets where traditional 
capabilities (e.g., actuary and underwriting) can make bigger 
differences in performance and profitability, or pivot toward an 
increased focus on commercial lines 
 In these markets, distribution and underwriting will continue to be 
relatively more manual and the insurers’ expertise will not be easily 
replicated or replaced

As access to granular data and sophisticated underwriting become 
necessary conditions for personal insurers to survive, those with 
insufficient scale to compete may choose to specialise in specific market 
segments. These segments will tend to require in-depth historical 
knowledge and niche distribution networks based on factors such as 
demographics (e.g., cancer patients), sector (e.g., medical SME), or 
region (e.g., Manhattan). Multi-line insurers who sell both personal and 
commercial policies today may also choose to exit the commoditised 
personal insurance market and focus more heavily on the commercial 
market, where their specialised capabilities can lead to higher margins 
and growth / customer retention.

Case studies

Bought by Many, a UK-based insurance start-up, brings together customers with specific insurance needs 
(e.g., age, illness, residence location, profession) to represent their needs to insurers and promote the 
creation and distribution of specialised insurance products designed for them. Bought by Many matches 
customers who do not fit commoditised insurance policies to insurers who are willing to specialise in certain 
customer segments.

 Reduced customer stickiness: With insurers’ ownership of customer relationship further disaggregated and personal lines products further 
commoditised, customers will become more fickle and creating customer loyalty will become increasingly difficult
 Self-insurance models: The overall revenue for the insurance industry will be reduced as the agents of the commoditising forces (e.g., self-driving 
car manufacturers, sharing economy platforms) gain scale and begin to self-insure
 Competitive benchmarking: Insurers’ ability to scan and benchmark against competitors’ pricing models and strategies will become more 
important as customers gain visibility into prices from multiple insurers via digital distribution platforms
 How will insurers create customer loyalty and stickiness going forward as the insurance products become increasingly commoditised and new, 
digital entrants disaggregate customer relationship?
 What role will insurers play in supporting the self-insuring agents of commoditising forces in response to the erosion of the premium base?
 How can the insurance industry cultivate innovation ecosystem amidst risk-averse culture in order to proactively manage the disaggregating forces 
instead of reacting to them?

Insurance: Increasing Levels of Connectivity

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 Increasing adoption of connected devices in cars, homes and lifestyles presents an opportunity for insurers to expand the use of telematics, i.e., the 
integration of telecommunication and information processing

Future of Personal Insurance

 Expansion of the telematics insurance models through connected devices and platforms will create channels for insurers to better understand their 
customers and engage more closely with them
‒ Connected devices can allow insurers to track and continuously refine individual risk profiles, enabling more accurate underwriting of individual 
risks and more personalised products
‒ Insurers can also evolve into a risk manager for clients by interacting more frequently with their customers and proactively participating in risk 
management through their customers’ connected devices
‒ Furthermore, insurers could leverage the individualised data gathered through connected devices to gain a fuller view of customers’ identities 
and lifestyles, and work with retailers and external parties to deliver relevant, and financially beneficial, offers to customers 

Key Implications

 To reap the benefits of new business models enabled by connected devices, insurers must work closely with device and service providers and must 
also define acceptable boundaries in utilising customer data

71

Insurance: Increasing Levels of Connectivity

The business model for property & casualty (P&C) and health insurance has

 Risks are priced based on the data customers submitted and some 3rd party data, including historical data and predictive indicators, against 
loss models and clusters created by insurers based on historical statistics
 After binding, insurers and customers do not interact until renewal unless specific events are triggered such as claims (e.g., accidents) or 
servicing (e.g., address change)
 Customers’ usage and losses are reflected in their risk profile only in the underwriting process during the next renewal cycle

3

Improvement opportunities in the traditional P&C and health insurance model

Backward-looking

Limited interactions

Passive

Despite the gradual improvement on the 
accuracy of loss prediction models, losses are 
predicted using historical indicators. Most pricing 
models do not adjust to real-time individual 
behavioural and usage data. 

Profitable, claim-free customers typically do not 
interact with insurers until renewal, limiting 
insurers’ ability to demonstrate value to them 
and develop stickiness

Insurers only react to customers’ predicted risk 
profiles upon binding and at renewal, with little to 
no visibility into proactive risk management 
opportunities throughout the policy term

72

Insurance: Increasing Levels of Connectivity

Telematics offers a promising proposition to P&C and health insurers and 
customers, but its adoption is slow due to a number of factors

What is telematics?

 First introduced in the mid-2000s, telematics insurance products leverage the GPS technology and wireless communications to enable auto insurers 
to collect usage and behaviour data of their customers in real time or near-real time
 Leveraging such data, insurers charge customers’ premiums based on their usage of the vehicles and current driving behaviours instead of typical 
fixed premiums, given the strong correlation between usage of vehicles and risks
 Today’s telematics devices have evolved to measure a variety of additional behavioural factors from rapid acceleration to air bag deployment

Benefits of telematics

Factors inhibiting adoption of telematics

 Pricing Accuracy: Insurers’ risk models become more accurate as 
individual, empirical and near real-time data is used combined with 
historical predictions based on segmentation
 Lower Claims: Telematics products incentivise safer behaviours 
among customers as premiums are linked directly to the behaviours 
and reduce the overall claims losses for insurers 
 Personalisation: As usage and behavioural data accumulates, the 
insurance premium becomes increasingly personalised to each 
customer, resulting in lower premiums for customers and customer 
stickiness for insurers

Device

Selection

 Installation of physical tracking devices creates an 
additional “moment of truth” when customers may 
abandon adoption of telematics 
 Only predominantly low-risk customers sign up for 
telematics-based insurance contracts and high-risk 
customers opt out, deterring insurers’ economics

Delays

 Gathering and utilisation of data is usually delayed 
due to connectivity, costs and analytical power

Incentives

 Discounts often do not serve as sufficient incentives 
for customers to adopt and share personal data

 Gather and transmit information on every 
part of the vehicle 
 Communicate with other cars to prevent 
accidents

 Monitor key metrics (e.g., temperature) and 
automatically modify the environment 
accordingly based on learning
 Identify risk factors (e.g., smoke) and take 
adequate actions for prevention / triaging
 Communicate with the environment to adapt 
to surrounding environments

 Quantify, track, monitor and manage daily 
activities through wearable devices
 Identify trends, patterns and 
recommendations based on quantified data
 Measure, track and analyse vitals relevant 
for specific conditions and illness

 Increase interoperability; facilitate data gathering, management and utilisation; and improve coordination among connected devices

4. Standardised Platforms

Easier utilization of data

Key advantages

Real-time communication

Gathered data can be shared easily via 
connectivity and data-based services can be

74

Insurance: Increasing Levels of Connectivity

Proliferation of connected insurance models will create channels for P&C and 
health insurers to better understand and engage more closely with their customers

Key characteristics of the future connected insurance business model

Personalisation

Increased measurability and availability of 
personal data will allow insurers to refine their 
understanding of customers’ risks from cluster-
based approach to individualised pricing

Accuracy

Transparency

With better understanding of each individual’s 
risks, the pricing accuracy of insurers will 
improve and more customers will pay 
premiums appropriate for their risks (i.e., less 
cross-subsidisation among customers)

As customers’ usage and behaviours become 
more measurable, insurers will gain greater 
visibility into the circumstances surrounding 
claims and the opportunities for fraud will 
decrease

Data-Rich

Insurers will become a critical custodian of 
customer data as they gain access to 
behavioural data on their customers 
(e.g., vehicle movement), above and beyond 
historical and static data available today 
(e.g., type of vehicle owned)

Engagement

Insurers will be able to access additional 
channels to engage with their customers 
through mobile and other connected platforms 
and generate more relevant content for their 
customers based on data

As insurers are enabled with additional data and communication channels from connected devices 
and platforms, how will the value delivered by insurance companies evolve?

Narrative

A wider adoption of wearable devices (e.g., wristbands) and smarter home 
sensors (e.g., smart thermometers), as well as the development of 
aggregation platforms, allows insurers to expand usage-based offerings to 
home and health policies. As the result, customers pay premiums that are 
more customised to their risk profiles and usage.
In the automotive space the adoption of standardised platforms and 
improved sensors enables insurers to create app-based telematics offerings 
that customers can easily sign up for. Through these apps, customers can 
purchase additional coverage for specific events.

Summary of impact

 Connected devices create a real-time stream of more granular, 
individualised, empirical data, enabling insurers to track, analyse, 
understand and continuously refine individual risk profiles for more 
accurate underwriting of individual and organisational risks
 Telematics and usage-based-insurance become readily adoptable 
through the elimination of the need for physical devices and the 
development of standardised platforms
 Increased connectivity via mobile creates a channel for consumers to 
purchase event-based coverage to personalise their policies for better 
protection

Case studies

Leading mobile platforms are creating 
standardised platforms that enable the 
development of apps that can be installed across 
many vehicles from different automakers. These 
apps can enable real-time gathering of granular 
driving data

Wearable devices that can track users’ lifestyle 
data are gaining popularity and a number of 
portable health solutions to track key vitals are 
being developed. Mobile OS and device makers 
have also begun to introduce platforms to 
connect and aggregate data from these devices

Smarter sensors and control devices (e.g., fire 
alarms, thermostats) are gaining popularity in 
households and aggregation platforms are 
emerging to establish connection among and 
provide central management of those devices 
and sensors

Risk Advice

Narrative

Utilising driving patterns gathered from connected cars and 3rd party data 
(e.g., weather), insurers send warnings and advice via in-car applications 
to support safer driving by their customers 
As health insurers gain more granular data on customers’ lifestyles and 
better understand indicators for future illness, they arrange health 
consultants to high risk customers via mobile apps 
As a result, customers benefit by avoiding accidents and illness and find 
their insurance policy more valuable, whereas the frequency and 
magnitude of losses are reduced for insurers

Summary of impact

 Collection and analyses of more granular data allows insurers to more 
accurately understand behavioural risk factors and predict near and 
long-term increases in risk
 Connected devices create a bilateral channel for insurers to interact 
more frequently with their customers and proactively get involved in 
managing their customers’ risks before events occur
 By evolving into a manager for their client’s risks, insurers can lower 
losses while delivering additional value to customers

Case studies

Marmalade Insurance, a UK based insurance company, targets less-
experienced driver segments with its telematics offering by providing 
feedback and e-learning based on driving behaviour to promote safer 
driving

Vitality Health’s app encourages its customers to voluntarily track and 
share lifestyle data with the insurer. The app then provides analysis and 
feedback based on the gathered data, and rewards customers for 
healthier lifestyle choices with gifts and other benefits

Summary of impact

Insurers already gather static data on customers’ properties (e.g., make of

their customers’ behaviour with sufficient granularity to create a 
comprehensive picture of their identity and lifestyle. Automotive insurers 
will be able to predict future erosion of tires and collaborate with auto parts 
retailers to send discount offers to replace tires based on the make of 
vehicles. Home insurers could utilise customer data to predict a vacation 
approaching and offer discounts on travel packages as well as travel 
insurance. These offers will provide additional financial value to 
customers, encouraging loyalty and supporting proactive risk 
management.

Case studies

 Connected cars, homes and health devices will allow insurers to gather 
ongoing behavioural data from their customers, which can be combined 
with existing asset data to better understand customers’ identity and

Deposits & Lending

How will emerging alternative models 
of lending change the market 
dynamics of traditional lenders?

84

Deposits & Lending: Alternative Models of Lending

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 Following the financial crisis, lower risk appetites among retail banks have significantly limited access to traditional bank intermediated lending. This 
is particularly true among sub-prime borrowers
 Over the same period of time alternative lending platforms leveraging P2P models have experienced rapid growth. These platforms use alternative 
adjudication methods and lean, automated processes to offer loans to a broader base of customers and a new class of investment opportunities to 
savers 

Future of Savings & Lending

 As competitive pressures from alternative lending platforms grow, the overall savings and lending industry will be forced to compete
‒ Alternative lenders could successfully move upstream to replace traditional institutions in intermediating prime loans while traditional lenders, 
restricted by legacy processes and high capital requirements, lose share 
‒ Alternatively, traditional institutions and alternative platforms may continue to cater to different classes of investors and borrowers, especially 
with growing partnerships between smaller traditional institutions and alternative platforms 
‒ Traditional institutions could also transform their processes and technologies, potentially absorbing alternative platforms, to adopt the key 
features of alternative lending business models

Key Implications

 Emerging alternative lending models create both competitive threats and evolutionary opportunities for financial institutions, making it important for 
incumbent institutions and alternative platforms to develop more integrated partnerships and learn from and share each other’s capabilities

85

Deposits & Lending: Alternative Models of Lending

In a risk-averse economy, retail banks’ model of intermediating savers and 
borrowers has reduced accessibility to loans for subprime customers

How do financial institutions facilitate lending activities today?

 Retail banks receive savings from their account holders and provide interest on the 
savings in return. In most countries, regulators mandate banks to insure and hold 
minimum reserve on the savings held

 Using the saved funds, retail banks originate loans to borrowers and receive interest 
in return. The availability of loans and the interest rates are determined by the 
adjudication of borrowers’ risk profiles, typically using credit scores

Risk-
averse

 Typically, interest received on loans are higher than interest paid on savings to 
account for default risks and other operational costs

 The breadth of borrowers served is dependent on each bank’s risk appetite, which is 
generally related to the size and scale of the banks (e.g., riskier borrowers tend to 
be served by tier 2/3 banks or balance sheet lenders)

Evolution of traditional lending models

Key characteristics of traditional models

 Following the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, customer trust 
surrounding financial services quickly dissipated
 Regulators also mandated increased safety measures around loans 
(e.g., higher capital requirements) which resulted in many banks 
tightening loan requirements 
 This mutual loss of confidence created a lending gap, leaving a 
considerable portion of borrowing needs underserved by financial 
institutions
 Furthermore, customer preferences in financial services are rapidly 
changing, demanding more transparency, efficiency and control over 
their savings and loans

Limited Access

A growing lending gap limits 
the availability of loans to 
individuals and companies with 
higher risk profiles

Slow Speed

Traditional adjudication processes 
with multiple layers of approval 
limits the banks’ ability to process 
loans in timely manner

Margin for Error

Traditional adjudication models 
and credit scores tend to miss 
suitable lending opportunities in 
a virtual economy

Poor Customer Experience 

Highly manual adjudication 
processes and requirements fall 
short of increasing expectations 
on customer experiences

Limited Control

Borrowers have limited visibility 
and control over the uses of funds 
and interest rates earned

Low Return

Operational inefficiency and 
reduced risk appetite of banks 
result in low returns on savings 

86

Deposits & Lending: Alternative Models of Lending

Alternative lending platforms leverage P2P models and lean operations to offer 
seamless services to a broader base of customers

Description of alternative lending models

 Alternative lending institutions have emerged to fill gaps in the traditional lending 
model. New industry players are emerging across the globe, showcasing a myriad 
of value propositions and strategies that are challenging traditional business models
 Online and P2P (P2P) lending platforms provide customers low-cost, fast, flexible, 
and more customer-oriented alternatives to mainstream retail banking that 
traditional financial institutions once dominated
 While the business models of alternative lenders often differ from one another, most 
providers directly link borrowers and lenders, employ advanced adjudication 
methods and streamline processes

 Alternative lending platforms assess the 
creditworthiness of borrowers based on 
metrics beyond the credit scores used by 
traditional lenders (e.g., social data) 
 Most alternative lenders also refine their risk 
engine more frequently than traditional 
lenders to incorporate feedback based on 
empirical analysis

 Alternative lending platforms are free of 
legacy processes and technologies, allowing 
them to onboard and assess borrowers and 
lenders in a more streamlined fashion
 At most alternative platforms, assessment of 
borrowers is at least partly automated against 
predefined rules for fast, transparent 
processing

87

Deposits & Lending: Alternative Models of Lending

Traditional and alternative lending models differ significantly in their flexibility and 
allocation of risk 

 Traditional lending intermediaries (e.g., retail banks) take risks themselves and leverage their scale to provide stability to lenders (depositors), 
however their focus is typically limited to low-risk borrowers and they charge high fees (in form of interest spread). Therefore the needs of risk-seeking 
savers and high-risk borrowers are not fully served by traditional banks
 Alternative lending platforms typically provide an online marketplace where lenders have the flexibility to pick and choose a desired risk portfolio. The 
marketplace generates lenders’ scores and typically takes a cut of loan originations and ongoing loan revenues but does not directly take risks

 Traditional intermediaries hold savings from retail, 
commercial and institutional clients and provide interest in 
return
 Using those funds, traditional intermediaries originate 
loans to borrowers based on their creditworthiness and 
earn interest (the differential between interest, or “spread” 
is the intermediary’s return)

 Alternative lending platforms directly match lending needs 
of borrowers with willing lenders (individuals or institutions)
 Contractual obligations exist directly between borrowers 
and lenders and platforms provide mere intermediation 
and adjudication
 Alternative platforms are compensated through 
originations fees or a percentage of interest payments

 Lenders’ savings are protected by the intermediaries’ 
reserves and by deposit insurance schemes
 The complete pooling of savings and loans most effectively 
mitigates individual default risks

 Lending processes and risk profiles are transparent to both 
borrowers and lenders
 Traditionally underserved borrowers gain access to loans 
and diverse risk appetite of lenders is met
 Reduction of transaction costs

 Lenders do not have flexibility to determine the desired 
level of risk and return
 Primary focus on low risk loans exclude higher risk 
borrowers, depending on the market conditions

 Investments may be more susceptible to individual default 
risks even with portfolio approach, especially for smaller 
investments
 Guarantees on the investments are limited

88

Deposits & Lending: Alternative Models of Lending

Alternative lending platforms are creating competitive pressures to savings and 
lending industry to become more transparent and customer friendly

Key characteristics of future deposits and lending models

More Accurate Underwriting

Adverse selection by lending intermediaries 
with superior underwriting capabilities will lead 
to a broader adoption of alternative credit 
indicators for adjudication and pricing

Increased Access

Use of alternative adjudication and 
diversification of lenders will provide more 
lending options to a broader spectrum of 
borrowers (e.g., “thin file” borrowers)

Control and Transparency

Lenders will gain more control over the return 
on their savings based on their risk appetite 
and more visibility into the flow of 
their savings

Reduced Costs for Borrowers/ 
Increased Return for Savers

As the understanding of risk profiles of 
borrowers is improved, the margins of lending 
intermediaries may be pressured, resulting in 
lower cost of obtaining loans for borrowers and 
increased return for lenders 

Fast and Customer Friendly

Streamlined and automated processes 
expedite loan processing and improve 
customer experience for borrowers

While enabling these future state characteristics, how will emerging alternative models of lending 
change the market dynamics of traditional lenders?

Narrative

Summary of impact

As the position of alternative lending platforms in the high-risk lending 
market matures, alternative lending marketplaces will gain sufficient 
customer trust and reputation to attract more risk-adverse investors and 
low-risk borrowers. The ability of alternative lending platforms to offer 
borrowers lower interest rates and a more streamlined customer 
experience will also help attract and retain low-risk borrowers.
As lending marketplaces move upstream to prime lending markets they 
may evolve to become the primary origination point for consumer lending 
and an investment destination for a portion of bank’s deposit float.

 Leveraging alternative adjudication methods, streamlined processes, 
and lower overhead, alternative lenders successfully move upstream 
and emerge as a cheaper and faster direct competitor to traditional 
lending institutions in the low-risk lending space
 Entrenched by legacy processes / technologies and capital 
requirements, traditional institutions do not adapt quickly enough and 
lose share to leaner and more consumer-friendly alternative lending 
platforms

Case studies

Launched in 2005 as the world’s first P2P lending service, 
Zopa targets only prime lenders as determined by its 
adjudication model, and competes with traditional institutions 
on rates / returns and a more seamless originations process. 
In 2014, Zopa achieved a default rate of 0.38 percent, 
significantly lower than traditional institutions.

Launched in 2006, CreditEase started as a Chinese P2P 
lending service, aiming to bridge urban lenders with excess 
funds and an underbanked rural population with borrowing 
needs. Building on its success CreditEase has grown to offer 
other financial products and services, such as wealth 
management products for high net worth customers.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Unable to build sufficient customer awareness / trust, particularly in the 
market for low-risk lending, alternative lenders enter into partnerships with 
existing financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions are able to 
refer high-risk borrowers who do not meet minimum lending requirements 
to alternative platforms, thereby helping those customers fulfill their 
financing needs without the risk of losing other elements of their business 
(e.g., deposit accounts, credit cards) to another traditional financial 
institution.
Some smaller, and more regional, institutions may also find it beneficial to 
“park” excess funds with their lending marketplace partners as a 
mechanism for diversifying their lending portfolios.

 Traditional institutions and alternative lending platforms continue to 
cater to different classes of investors and borrowers – traditional 
institutions cater to the low-risk market based on trust, and alternative 
platforms cater to the high-risk market based on access
 Some traditional institutions with limited lending bandwidth may partner 
with alternative lenders to meet the underserved needs of their 
customer base, by referring customers or investing excess capital
 Overall, more customers gain access to savings and lending products 
that best suit their needs as the industry becomes more diversified

Case studies

In 2014, Lending Club (an alternative lending platform) and Union Bank (a U.S. regional bank) formed a strategic 
alliance. Under the agreement, Union Bank plans to purchase personal loans through the Lending Club’s platform and 
work with the platform on the co-creation of new credit products. Through the partnership, Union Bank can meet the 
borrowing needs of its sub-prime customer segments while earning higher interest on its strong balance sheet.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Responding to the threat of alternative lending platforms, traditional 
institutions transform their technologies and processes and / or acquire 
the alternative platforms. This allows traditional institutions to leverage 
alterative adjudication methods, deliver a more streamlined lending 
process, and improve efficiency to potentially offer lower interest rates. It 
will also allow them to selectively cater to more borrowers that traditionally 
fell in underserved categories.

 Traditional institutions transform their processes and technologies or 
absorb alternative platforms to adopt the key features of an alternative 
lending business model, such as alternative adjudication and 
streamlined processes, to provide compelling value proposition to 
customers
 Traditional institutions successfully create financial products beyond 
savings products to cater to the borrowing needs of high-risk borrowers 
and provide the desired level of return to risk-seeking lenders

Case studies

Advanced Merchant Payments (AMP) helps traditional financial institutions transform and supplement their 
adjudication models with alternative methods to improve underwriting accuracy of small / medium enterprise 
loans. For instance AMP enables financial institutions to leverage merchant acquiring data in adjudication, 
which is more accurate indication of a company’s cash flow and readily accessible by financial institutions.

processes and IT infrastructure 
 The ability of traditional financial institutions to achieve cost 
competitiveness with alternative lending platforms by adopting 
alternative adjudication and process improvements

 Significant improvement in customer experience and 
availability of loans / investment opportunities without 
customers having to change service providers

Incumbents

 Ability to directly serve their customer base’s borrowing

 Reduced leakage during lending application process 
due to streamlined straight-through processing

Overall 
Ecosystem

 Incumbents remain dominant with minimal changes to 
ecosystem but significant improvements are made in 
the efficiency of the lending process

What does this mean for financial institutions?

Key implications and remaining questions

“Safe Bets” – Likely implications under all scenarios

!

!

 Erosion of deposits and investment products: As savers leverage alternative lending platforms as short and medium-term investment vehicles, 
erosion will occur among traditional deposits and investment products (e.g., money market funds) offered by traditional institutions, ultimately 
leading to some balance sheet shrinkage
 Distributed credit: Customers’ savings and credit portfolios could become distributed over a large number of alternative platforms with varying 
reporting standards, making it difficult for financial institutions to measure each customer’s creditworthiness on a consistent basis
 How will retail banks continue to maintain their ability to serve lending needs of customers as the erosion of deposits to alternative lending platforms 
leads to a smaller balance sheet?
 How will retail banks continue to accurately and consistently assess creditworthiness as customers’ loan portfolios become distributed and the 
measurement of creditworthiness becomes increasingly diversified?

Deposits & Lending: Shifting Customer Channel Preferences

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 Driven by generational shifts and rapid consumer adoption of technology, customers’ channel preferences for financial products and services are 
shifting rapidly 
 These changing customer preferences have manifested in a number of innovations, from the development of virtual banks to the evolution of mobile 
banking capabilities, and the development of “banking as platform” movement

Future of Primary Accounts

 As customer expectations for financial institutions continue to rise, financial institutions will be required to create a fuller virtual experience that is 
more customer driven, potentially changing the role of primary account providers
‒ Increasing customer demand and growing trust with tech companies may enable non-traditional firms that excel in creating digital customer 
experiences to assume control of the customer relationship, while traditional institutions focus on manufacturing financial products
‒ Full-service virtual banks could offer a comprehensive suite of financial products by partnering with a range of niche alternative providers (e.g., 
P2P lenders, automated asset managers); allowing the network of alternative providers to compete directly with full-service retail banks
‒ In the future financial institutions could leverage virtual channels to offer frequent customer interactions and non-financial value-adds above and 
beyond needs-based transactions to strengthen customer relationships

Key Implications

 As customers’ demands continues to grow, it will become increasingly difficult for financial institutions to cater to all the needs of customers. In the 
future – financial institutions should consider what portion of their business they would like to retain and what partnerships can deliver better value 
to customers

99

Deposits & Lending: Shifting Customer Channel Preferences

These changing customer preferences have manifested in a number of 
innovations emerging across primary account providers

What are the key innovations manifested by shifting customer channel preferences?

Virtual Banks

Evolution of Mobile Banking

Banking as Platform

 “Direct Banks” first emerged in the 1990s 
based on telephone banking and have since 
evolved to become more “virtual,” relying on 
online / mobile channels
 Most virtual banks established to date have 
been subsidiaries of large traditional financial 
institutions, targeting their price-sensitive 
customer segments 
 Today, improved technology is allowing 
virtual banks to offer new and compelling 
value propositions beyond just lower cost

 Rapid adoption of mobile devices has led 
many financial institutions to quickly add 
digital channels for basic transactions 
 However, these channels often struggle to 
meet customers’ demands for fully functional 
mobile platforms
 Free of legacy systems, non-traditional 
players are emerging to offer mobile apps 
that make financial transactions even more 
effortless for customers (e.g., P2P money 
transfer, photo bill payment, voice 
recognition)

 Legacy systems and competing priorities limit 
the speed at which traditional players can 
offer innovative online and mobile tools; 
particularly for smaller institutions where the 
cost to deliver a full suite of solutions to meet 
diverse customer needs can be prohibitive
 Banking-as-platform movement aims to 
standardise APIs across financial institutions 
allowing 3rd party developers to easily build 
and integrate customer-facing enhancements 
to the institutions’ core offerings

Narrative

Summary of impact

A partnership is launched between a financial institution with no retail 
banking presence and a technology player with existing customer 
relationships, customer trust, and an expertise in the creation of online 
experiences. Together these partners leverage their respective expertise 
in a seamless digital customer experience and manufacturing financial 
products to create a new kind of online financial experience complete with 
a full suite of financial products.
The structure of the partnership allows the technology player to increase 
their access of data and centrality to the lives of their customers with 
limited pressure on their balance sheet or increased regulatory exposure.

 In the face of rising customer expectations for a highly flexible, intuitive 
and personalised service across multiple platforms, new and existing 
players who are accustomed to providing these sort of solutions 
disaggregate the manufacturing of financial products from the 
ownership of customer relationships
 Traditional financial institutions evolve to become manufacturers of 
financial products, shifting freed capacity from distribution to focus on 
manufacturing sophisticated or highly personalised products

Case studies

Many leading technology players chose to enter the mobile payments space by partnering with established financial institutions and leveraging white-
label products. This allowed them to focus on their own expertise in customer interactions (e.g., marketing, UX, offers) while relying on their financial 
partners’ infrastructure and capabilities. Paypal’s mobile payment solution used Discover’s payment network infrastructure for acquiring, approval, 
clearing and settlement, while a core component of Google Wallet’s mobile offering involves a virtual pre-paid Visa card issued by US Bancorp.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Alternative providers of niche financial services continue to mature and 
become reliable alternatives to offerings of traditional institutions. Initially, 
connections develop among these niche providers through bi- or multi-
lateral partnerships. Eventually, some traditional banks shift their focus to 
managing customer relationships as “depositories of trust” and serve as a 
central platform for connections to niche providers’ products. Alternatively, 
digital wallets (e.g., Google Wallet, PayPal) or online marketplaces (e.g., 
Money Supermarket, Amazon) may evolve to become those central 
platforms. 
These network of non-traditional niche providers collectively meet 
customers’ banking needs and compete with traditional full service banks. 
They also provide the ability to seamlessly mix and match niche providers 
that fit the clients needs in a fashion not possible within today’s full service 
financial institutions.

 “Light” or virtual financial institutions emerge that only focus on account 
management, offering a comprehensive suite of financial products by 
partnering with a range of niche providers of financial services (e.g., 
alternative lending, alternative payment rails)
 These partnerships allow a network of alternative financial service 
providers to compete directly with full-service retail banks
 Customers are able to select the products that best fit their needs and 
pay transparent fees since financial products are not cross-subsidised

Case studies

Simple is a low cost, virtual-only bank that provides primary account services to its customers with a focus on improving 
customers’ ability to save, budget and control their spending. Simple has partnered with a number of traditional and 
emerging financial institutions to provide fuller functionalities to customers: Visa to facilitate payments (debit cards), 
Venmo to enable mobile payments, Bankcorp and CBW to deposit savings in FDIC-insured products, and Allpoint to 
provide a fee-free access to ATM networks.

Branch & Digital / Daily Touchpoints

Description of the scenario

Potential development stories

To meet evolving customer demands, financial institutions actively explore 
innovations in mobile and other virtual channels’ transactional services. 
Empowered by smarter machines that can emulate human-human 
interactions, financial institutions automate previously high-touch, high-
value services and deliver them through virtual channels to increase 
touchpoints with customers.
Financial institutions also build on their core competencies today and 
extend them to tangent spaces (e.g., extending secure management of 
finances to personal data / identity management) to play a bigger role in 
customers’ lives and improve customer loyalty and retention.

 Financial institutions leverage virtual channels to offer frequent 
enriched interactions with customers above and beyond today’s needs-
based transactions in order to strengthen customer relationships
 Virtual channels may present an opportunity for financial institutions to 
evolve their role from providing financial transactional and value-add 
services to delivering non-financial services to customers (e.g., 
concierge services for high value customers, custodian of data, identity 
management) without significantly increasing costs

Capital Raising

How will the evolution of distributed capital 
raising impact the role of traditional 
intermediaries?

110

Capital Raising: Alternative Funding Platforms

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 Traditionally, capital raising activities have been facilitated by specialised financial institutions, leveraging their deep expertise to identify and 
support investment opportunities. Access to investments in these intermediaries has been limited to select high net worth and institutional investors
 In the face of growing interest in start-ups and digital democratisation, a series of alternative funding platforms have emerged, widening access to 
capital raising activities and providing funding to a greater number of companies and projects

Future of Alternative Funding Platforms 

 While these alternative funding platforms are not likely to replace the traditional capital raising ecosystem in the short or medium term, their growth 
could change the role of incumbent institutions
‒ Alternative funding platforms may solidify their position as a key capital raising intermediary for higher risk seed-stage companies, which would 
increase their access to funding and increase the number of new firms eligible for venture capital
‒ Alternative platforms could also evolve to focus on investors with motives beyond financial return. They could help funnel capital to low-return 
opportunities that would not have qualified for investment from traditional venture capitalists but provide non-financial returns to crowd investors 
(e.g., alternative energy projects or local development projects) 
‒ Alternative capital raising platforms could also provide a channel for larger companies to raise capital directly from their customers base, 
potentially reducing costs while supporting customer engagement

Key Implications

 The opportunities created by the proliferation of alternative capital raising platforms likely outweigh the risks they pose to incumbent institutions as 
they enable a more diversified pipeline of investment opportunities to support a richer innovation ecosystem

111

Capital Raising: Alternative Funding Platforms

Capital raising has been traditionally facilitated by specialised institutions with 
deep expertise, but individual investors have limited access so far

How do financial institutions facilitate capital raising activities today?

 While smaller loans for small / medium enterprises are directly issued by retail / 
commercial banks, larger capital needs of companies are typically fulfilled by issuing 
equity or debt through a specialised intermediary like an investment bank
 Unlike lending transactions where loans are issued from the banks’ balance sheet, 
investment banks facilitate the structuring, marketing and sales of equity or debt 
capital to potential investors and charge a fee to the issuing company (in certain 
cases, banks participate as an investor by buying shares / bonds, managing 
investors funds or providing a lending facility)
 Issuing companies directly pay back principal and interest on debt or pay dividends 
for equity to the investors
 Layers of financial institutions, from venture capital to investment banks, specialise 
in and focus on various stages of businesses to facilitate capital raising

Emerging pressure on traditional lending models

Key challenges with traditional models

 Increased connectivity, the success of internet start-ups, changing 
consumption behaviours and increasingly entrepreneurship-friendly 
policies have fueled a rapid increase in the number of start-ups, making 
effective screening and selection processes by traditional funding 
options (e.g., venture capital) increasingly difficult
 To maintain control and agility, rapid growth companies continue to 
delay accessing the public pool of capital via IPOs, aided by policies 
and regulations permitting widening of investor base without going 
public (e.g., Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act))
 As a result, an imbalance is created between supply and demand for 
capital in the private market, calling for alternative models to provide 
the funding required

Limited Access

Access to capital can be limited 
by the size, history and 
relationships of a business

Timely Supply of Capital

Lengthy structuring and fulfillment 
process may limit timely access to 
capital

Standardised Measurement

Appeal to investors is determined 
strictly by risk / return and funding 
may be limited for opportunities 
with alternative propositions

Loss of Control

Businesses may lose control over 
key decisions to investors and 
individual investors do not have 
direct control over their 
investments

Potential for Inadequate Funding

The ability to meet funding needs at a fair price 
can be deterred by the capability of the 
intermediating institution

112

Capital Raising: Alternative Funding Platforms

Alternative funding platforms enable the crowd to play a bigger role in providing 
capital to investment opportunities

Description of alternative funding platforms

 Alternative funding platforms provide an opportunity for businesses to interact 
directly with individual investors to widen options for raising capital
 Instead of providing investment advice or directly marketing investments in equity 
or debt capital, alternative funding platforms aggregate investment opportunities, 
provide a standardised view of the opportunities and facilitate legal structuring of 
equity or debt issued
 The rating of investment opportunities are conducted through the wisdom of the 
crowd (i.e., minimum target must be met for successful funding) or by allowing 
more experienced individual investors to lead the investment activities, instead of 
using credit rating agencies or sell-side analysts

Customisation

 Alternative funding platforms provide a 
marketplace for individual investors to directly 
discover and invest in investment 
opportunities
 Investment opportunities are typically only 
funded when a pre-determined target is met, 
to weed out less credible or less promising 
opportunities through “crowd’s approval”

 Some alternative funding platforms leverage 
the expertise of more experienced individual 
investors in certain fields (e.g., angel 
investors) by providing them an opportunity to 
lead funding for desired investments
 Some platforms allow these “lead” investors 
to gain additional income through fees, similar 
to carries paid to general partners of private 
equity firms 

 Alternative funding platforms provide a 
number of customisable parameters for 
businesses to adjust and easily design 
funding options desirable for them 
(e.g., term, equity share)
 Moreover, some platforms allow businesses 
to build in unique clauses, such as rewards, 
to make them appealing to investor segments

114

Capital Raising: Alternative Funding Platforms

The proliferation of alternative funding platforms will make the capital raising 
market more diversified and accessible

Key characteristics of the future capital raising market

Increased Accuracy

As more individual investors get involved in 
funding decisions, the business’ prospects will 
be tested from multiple perspectives. This 
“wisdom of the crowd” may improve the 
accuracy of overall investment decisions

Increased Access

Increased Control

As more individual investors receive 
opportunities to directly fund businesses, more 
businesses and projects will gain access to 
potential funding options

Individual investors will gain more control over 
where their investments flow and determine 
whether they want direct control over 
investment decisions

Reduced Costs

Diversified Options

As individual investors participate directly in 
funding without going through intermediaries, 
their cost to invest will decrease, but the impact 
to overall profitability remains unclear

Businesses will be able to structure equity or 
debt more flexibly to meet funding needs and 
will offer more diversified incentives to potential 
investors to increase appeal

In enabling these future characteristics, how will the evolution of distributed capital raising impact 
the role of traditional intermediaries?

Narrative

Summary of impact

The popularity of peer-based funding platforms grows but remains focused 
on seed-stage ventures, with later stage firms opting to raise funds 
through traditional providers, such as venture capitalists, who are able to 
provide guidance and access to networks.
Within this environment early-stage companies can more easily test their 
product ideas, and gain exposure to potential customers, while later-stage 
companies can accelerate their growth through venture capital 
involvement. Some venture capitalists may partner with peer-based 
platforms as a sourcing channel for potential deals.

 Peer-based funding platforms solidify their position as the capital 
raising intermediaries for higher risk seed-stage companies
 Private equity and venture capital firms move upstream to focus on 
Series A or later stage ventures, where their networks and guidance 
matter most and risks of failure are lower
 Extending funding opportunities to more seed-stage companies makes 
the overall capital raising ecosystem richer by increasing the number of 
investment opportunities eligible for later-stage venture capital 
financing 

Case studies

Seedrs is an online peer-based capital raising platform for individual investors to discover and invest in 
seed-stage ventures. Investment opportunities at Seedrs provide equity shares to investors and only those 
investments that meet their funding target receive funding. Seedrs acts as a custodian for the individual 
investor’s equity to protect their interests and enable further rounds of investment.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Peer-based capital raising platforms that focus on seed-stage investment 
opportunities lose popularity among mass investors as they realise that 
the investment horizon is very long and the chance of a successful exit is 
extremely low.
Instead, peer-based platforms shift their focus to smaller projects that 
either have a higher chance of generating sustainable profits sooner, or 
can deliver benefits above and beyond financial return. Examples of non-
financial returns include community development (e.g., funding expansion 
of a favorite coffee shop, funding re-paving local roads) and ideological 
pursuits (e.g., sustainable energy).

 Peer-based funding platforms focus on connecting lower-return 
investment opportunities, which would not qualify for capital raising 
through traditional intermediaries, with investors with motives beyond 
financial return (e.g., empowering local community, sustainability)
 Seed-stage companies continue to be funded by traditional venture 
capitalists and angel investors who can provide appropriate guidance 
for growth
 Peer-based mechanisms are adopted by traditional intermediaries or 
high net worth individuals to encourage angel investor involvement

Case studies

Spacehive is a peer-based funding platform for civic 
projects, which enables local residents and 
businesses to fund community development projects 
(e.g., playgrounds, parks). Individuals with project 
ideas can directly pitch ideas to other residents 
through Spacehive and rally support and capital.

Abundance Generation is a peer-based capital raising 
platform for local or regional sustainable energy 
projects that are too small to be attractive to 
investment banks. The platform raises capital from 
environmentally conscious investors and facilitates 
issuance of debentures to create cash flow back to 
investors sooner.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Inspired by the ability of peer-based funding platforms to simultaneously 
raise funding and cultivate new clients, established companies partner 
with peer-based platforms to fund their growth. By engaging directly with 
customers large companies can gain exposure to potential customers and 
build deeper partnerships with exiting customers. Customers in turn feel 
that they are participating in the growth of their favourite businesses. 
Businesses can also further compensate or incentivise their customer-
investor base by providing perks that go beyond interest or dividends, 
such as future discounts.

 Large established companies utilise peer-based capital raising 
platforms as an alternative channel to raise capital directly from their 
customer base
 In addition to benefiting from implicit marketing and increased customer 
loyalty, larger companies further reduce direct cost of capital by 
providing non-financial incentives to customers (e.g., future discounts)
 Peer-based funding platforms develop into an alternative funding 
method that exists in parallel with the traditional capital raising 
ecosystem, potentially reducing traditional intermediaries’ businesses

Case studies

Chilango, a UK-based fast food chain, structured a campaign to raise £1 million for expansion by selling 
four-year corporate bonds with an 8 percent unsecured, unlisted coupon through peer-based capital 
raising platform, Crowdcube. In addition to offering a financial return (8 percent coupon), Chilango 
offered a free burrito every week for the duration of the bond to investors who invested more than 
£10,000 and a voucher for two free burritos to investors with smaller investments. This campaign raised 
£2.16 million from 749 investors, exceeding the target as the largest funds raised on the Crowdcube 
platform.

Investment Management: Empowerment of Individuals

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 The wealth management industry has suffered from the loss of customer trust since the financial crisis. This trust has been slow to recover in the 
face of continued economic uncertainties
 In this environment, a number of disruptors, from automated wealth management services to social trading platforms, have emerged to provide low-
cost, sophisticated alternatives to traditional wealth managers. These solutions cater to a broader customer base and empower customers to have 
more control of their wealth management

Future of Investment Management 

 These innovations will create pressures for the wealth management industry to improve the value delivered while broadening access to more 
customers
‒ Cheaper and faster online tools and automated services that originally catered to underserved customers may steal share from traditional wealth 
managers in the mass affluent market, pushing traditional managers to switch their focus to more personalised, relationship-based segments
‒ Alternatively, automated investment management platforms could commoditise traditional high-value services and reduce the value delivered by 
wealth managers across all customer segments, enabling traditional wealth managers to focus on providing more personalised, bespoke 
services to a broader customer base
‒ Empowered with intuitive and affordable tools, some individual investors may also gain sufficient level of sophistication to act as investment 
experts, selling and sharing their investment expertise via social trading platforms that erode the value of traditional wealth management 
professionals

Key Implications

 The emergence and growing popularity of automated wealth management services and customer empowerment tools will pose a tangible threat to 
the traditional practices of the wealth management industry. However, incumbent institutions who can embrace these innovations and streamline 
their processes will be able to provide higher value services to a broader customer base

 High fees limit access to wealth management 
services for mass and mass affluent clients

Customer 
Expectation

 Customers’ expectations of personalisation, efficiency 
and low costs continue to grow

Agility

 Ability to meet customer needs is limited by

Investment Management: Empowerment of Individuals

Disruptive innovation in wealth management pressures the industry to improve 
the value delivered to more customers

Key characteristics of the future of wealth management

Accessibility 

More sophisticated wealth management 
services will become available to a broader 
customer base, including the mass affluent and 
mass market customers

Transparency and Control

Customers will gain greater visibility into their 
financials and how their money is invested and 
will be able to make adjustments to their 
financials more readily as more wealth 
management options become available

Convenience

Online and mobile channels will be increasingly 
leveraged to interact with customers and 
deliver higher value services, providing access 
to financial information on demand

Personalised

Low Cost

As algorithms used in managing wealth 
become more sophisticated, the degree of 
customisation and individualisation will 
increase for services delivered to mass affluent 
and mass market customers

The cost of receiving advisory and 
management services will decrease as 
automation lowers the operating costs and new 
disruptive entrants spur competition in the 
market

As these disruptive innovations create pressures for the wealth management industry by 
empowering individuals, how will the wealth management landscape evolve?

Narrative

Summary of impact

As automated wealth management services and online tools establish a 
solid track record they continue to develop their service offerings to 
encompass functionalities desired by the mass affluent segment. 
Traditional wealth managers find their market share eroding as a growing 
number of mass affluent customers defect to lower cost automated 
options. Traditional wealth managers are forced to either develop their 
own automated solutions, accepting lower margins, or move upstream to 
higher new worth clients seeking a highly personalised experience.

 Cheaper and faster online tools and automated services that originally 
catered to underserved customers move upstream and steal share 
from traditional wealth managers in the mass affluent market
 Wealth managers, who have been expanding their focus to the mass 
affluent market, shift its focus back to more personalised and 
relationship-based high net-worth individuals, intensifying the 
competition and improving the services offered to those customers

Case studies

Launched in December 2011, Wealthfront offers an automated investment service that consists of managing a 
diversified, continually rebalanced portfolio of index funds, along with tax loss harvesting, via fully automated algorithms.
Unlike traditional wealth management companies, the minimum account size is small ($5,000) and fees are extremely 
low; which reduces the hurdles for entry for the Millennial generation. Since inception, Wealthfront has penetrated above 
and beyond Millennial customers to gather $1.5 billion in assets under management within three years.

Narrative

Summary of impact

Automated investment management platforms commoditise a large 
portion of the wealth management transactions by automating 
standardised activities (e.g., asset allocation) and formerly high-value 
services (e.g., tax loss harvesting). However, the demand for in-person 
interactions and other specialised transactions continues to exist across 
the customer segment spectrum.
In order to remain competitive against automated platforms, traditional 
wealth institutions adopt and further develop automated functionalities, 
which in return free up capacity for in-person wealth advisors. Leveraging 
freed capacity, wealth managers can now offer more specialised, high-
touch services to a broader customer base, improving the overall quality of 
services received by customers

 Automated investment management platforms commoditise services 
once considered high-value and reduce the value delivered by 
investment managers even to high net-worth customers
 Services provided by physical wealth managers evolve to be a more 
personalised financial concierge and expand to provide specialty in 
areas such as intergenerational wealth transfer 
 As incumbent institutions adopt improved automation, traditional wealth 
managers can free up capacity to expand their customer base

Case studies

Facing the threats of new automated investment services like Wealthfront, Charles Schwab announced the launch of its own 
automated investment service “Intelligent Portfolios” based on ETFs, featuring competitive capabilities like automatic 
rebalancing and tax loss harvesting, at no charge and with low minimum account threshold.

Summary of impact

Since the advent of online discount brokerages, the ability for individual 
investors to develop sophisticated strategies and participate in investment 
activities has grown continuously. Next generation tools (e.g., retail 
algorithmic trading platforms) are leveraging advanced algorithms, 
visualisation and cloud computing to eliminate traditional barriers like a 
need for programming skills. 
These innovations are narrowing the gap between individual and 
professional investors and facilitating the emergence of marketplaces for 
trading strategies and algorithms, enabling some of these empowered 
individuals to steal share from traditional investment managers.

 The next generation of retail and social trading platforms offer effective 
means for individuals to share or sell their investment expertise to other 
individual investors
 Sophisticated individual investors directly compete with traditional 
investment managers and aspects of the market for active retail 
investment management experience margin compression

Case studies

Quantopian allows sophisticated individual investors to build, 
test and execute algorithmic trading strategies with limited 
development knowledge and infrastructure, and manage other 
investors’ investments for a fee.

Estimize gathers stock-performance opinion from professional 
and individual investors (buy-side) to create price estimates that 
would mimic the market reaction, without relying on sell-side 
analysts.

Investment Management: Empowerment of Individuals

What does this mean for financial institutions?

Key implications and remaining questions

“Safe Bets” – Likely implications under all scenarios

!

!

 Decoupling of advisory and products: As more customers switch to automated advisors for more streamlined and cost-effective advisory 
services, the “one-stop” model of distributing financial institutions’ wealth products primarily via their advisory channels will become less effective
 Eroding advantages of scale: Traditional wealth managers’ scale-based advantages will erode as once manual processes are automated, virtual 
channels are utilised and core infrastructure become available at a low cost to new entrants
 Increased competition: The commoditising forces generated by new entrants will make more segments and services less profitable for traditional 
wealth managers and intensify competition among traditional players in more specialised segments or services 
 How will wealth managers that used to distribute their own products via advisory channels change their distribution strategy as new entrants 
providing automated digital solutions erode their customer base?
 What are the differentiated services provided by traditional wealth managers that will remain difficult to automate and replicate by new entrants?

How will the externalisation of key 
processes transform the financial 
ecosystem?

137

Investment Management: Process externalisation

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 Many processes within investment institutions are considered as “core” to their business operation. However, a new breed of process 
externalisation providers are using highly flexible platforms (typically based in the cloud) to provide financial institutions with increased efficiency 
and new levels of process sophistication / excellence

Future of Process externalisation 

 As service providers externalise and consolidate processes previously considered core capabilities, the core competencies that differentiate winning 
financial institutions shift from process execution to more “human” factors (e.g., synthesis, decision making)
 External service providers could enable small and medium-sized organisations to better compete with large incumbents by providing them access 
to top-tier processes that were once unreachable due to lack of scale 
 Some external providers that consolidate regulatory compliance capabilities may also create an opportunity to centralise communications to 
regulatory agencies. This would improve the speed at which financial institutions are able to respond to regulatory changes and ensure a higher 
level of compliance

Key Implications

 By exploring options to externalise a large number of redundant processes across institutions, firms will benefit from efficiency gains and increased 
sophistication
 However, financial institutions must consider which capabilities they should continue to focus on as a source of competitive advantage

138

Investment Management: Process externalisation

Many processes within investment management institutions considered as core 
to their business today are facing various pressures

Core capabilities of investment institutions today

 Over the past few decades, externalisation of non-core processes (e.g., HR, finance) has been a major trend in the financial services industry to drive 
efficiency and operational excellence

 Despite this trend many processes, such as transaction monitoring, regulatory compliance and risk management continue to be perceived as mission 
critical or competitive differentiators and have remained in house

Evolution of landscape impacting core processes

Key challenges faced by institutions

 The notion of core internal processes can change when external 
providers emerge with the ability to complete the process more 
efficiently and with more sophistication than individual institutions
‒ The ability to access and collect market data was once considered 
a critical internal competency for equity investments firms until 
external providers emerged to provide more standardised and 
comprehensive set of data (e.g., Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters)
 A number of issues are arising that impact the institutions’ ability to 
excel across today’s core processes:
‒ Increased regulatory burden as a result of the 2008 financial crisis 
(e.g., the Dodd-Frank Act) and the introduction of stricter 
compliance requirements (e.g., anti-money laundering) has taken up 
a large amount of institutions’ capacity
‒ Legacy processes and systems built based on the physical 
computing environment continue to limit institutions’ flexibility and 
agility in adapting to the rapidly changing market conditions and 
continuously evolving regulatory requirements

Capacity Constraints

High Cost of Maintenance

Lost capacity on updates and 
maintenance limits the ability to 
invest in core capabilities

Updating and maintaining 
processes and technologies are 
costly and time-consuming

Limited Flexibility / Agility

Inconsistency

Timely update of the processes 
and technologies is limited due to 
costs and efforts required

Fragmented, local legacy 
processes and technologies 
impede connectivity across the 
organisation

Scale-driven Barriers

Complexity

Sophistication of capabilities is 
not feasible due to the institutions’ 
scale and size

Inflexible systems designed for 
past market environments result 
in added complexity to adapt to 
the current environment

processes, as a service to institutions to 
minimise infrastructure investments required

 Facilitate institutions to work with one 
another to share capabilities or easily 
integrate with new providers by constructing 
legal and technical standards and vehicles

Investment Management: Process externalisation

The next generation of process externalisation not only brings efficiency, but also 
enables institutions to gain the level of sophistication unattainable by themselves

Key characteristics of the future state enabled by process externalisation

Automation

Flexibility / Agility

Sophistication

More processes will be automated and 
commoditised to free up capacity to invest in

Summary of impact

Financial institutions begin to outsource select processes to specialised 
external firms who leverage advanced technologies to provide improved 
outcomes at a much lower cost. Efforts previously spent on managing 
these processes in-house can be deployed toward higher value activities 
that provide competitive differentiation. 
As this pattern repeats over multiple processes, a financial institution’s 
competitive position ceases to be defined by core operational excellence 
and instead is defined by which higher value activities they have chosen to 
focus on.

 Service providers using advanced technologies provide options for 
financial institutions to externalise processes once considered core 
capabilities 
 Competitive advantages derived from excellence in process execution 
will disappear as high quality process execution becomes a commodity 
available for purchase
 Financial institutions are required to redefine what capabilities 
differentiate them from other institutions with process execution taking 
a backseat to more “human” factors

Case studies

The ability to quickly and accurately model market projections and hypotheses through large quant teams has 
traditionally been a key advantage of large financial institutions. Kensho threatens that advantage by offering a next-
generation analytics platform for the investment industry with massively-parallel statistical computing, scalable analytics 
architectures and user-friendly visual interfaces. By leveraging Kensho’s platform, any investment institution can now 
rapidly model projections without an army of quantitative analysts; instead focusing more “human” capabilities like 
hypothesis generation and market insights.

 Fewer process failures as they are externalised to more focused and 
specialised providers
 Emergence of institutions competing to excel in specific processes 
drives deeper specialisation
 Increased capacity for financial institutions to be innovative due to 
reduced focus on resource intensive core processes

 Centralisation of processes creates larger implications of process 
failures including continuity risks for banking in the case of a failure of 
an external service provider
 Risks resulting from potential lack of clarity surrounding accountabilities
 Loss of deep process knowledge within financial institutions may have 
unforeseen spill-over consequences in other areas of the business

vs.

Narrative

Once an external service provider has developed the tools for a financial 
institution to externalise a process, the cost of extending that service to 
additional financial institutions is typically very low and not dependent on 
the institution’s size.
Small and medium-sized financial institutions capitalise on these 
economics to both improve their efficiency and radically increase the 
sophistication of their processes across the board. As process 
sophistication ceases to be a source of competitive advantage for large 
financial institutions, small and medium-sized institutions are able to 
increase their focus on differentiating capabilities.

Summary of impact

 External service providers provide small and medium-sized 
organisations access to sophisticated capabilities, which were 
previously unattainable due to lack of scale
 Barriers to entry into the market will be lowered and the playing field 
will be leveled with small and medium-sized organisations increasingly 
able to compete with large institutions

Case studies

Open Gamma uses and an open source platform to provide real-time market risk management analytics to buy-side, sell-side 
and clearing institutions. While Open Gamma provides the platform free of charge, they offer support, consulting and training
services to help institutions configure and modify the platform and select appropriate risk models. The platform includes a 
number of advanced functions not normally available to small institutions. 
Through services like Open Gamma, new and small institutions no longer need to set up extensive support functions in middle 
and back offices to attain sophisticated capabilities and compete with larger institutions.

Compliance

Narrative

Summary of impact

A number of niche service providers are emerging who are able to 
externalise processes related to specific regulations (e.g., restricted 
holdings, KYC). These firms are able to interpret regulatory changes and 
translate them into rules that can be applied across various financial 
institutions, improving regulatory compliance and the speed at which 
financial institutions can respond to regulatory changes.
As regulatory compliance within financial institutions becomes more 
closely integrated with these service providers, some regulators may 
choose to collaborate directly with them even to the point of issuing 
regulations in code rather than as policy documents.

 More regulatory compliance and monitoring processes are outsourced 
to a small number of service providers with better connections to and 
understanding of regulations, reducing the compliance burden for 
financial institutions
 These compliance service providers can act as centralised 
communication touch point for regulators
 By solidifying their connections with regulators, these providers 
improve the speed at which financial institutions are able to respond to 
regulatory changes, ensuring a higher level of compliance

Case studies

FundApps organises regulatory information and delivers a cloud-based managed-service to automate shareholding 
disclosure and monitor investment restrictions across 100+ regulatory regimes on a daily basis. FundApps partners with 
a global legal service provider to monitor and translate changes in relevant regulations into rules on a daily basis.
If regulatory agencies partner with FundApps in the future, they could ensure consistent compliance across financial 
institutions, make dissemination of regulatory changes in disclosure regimes faster, and reduce the compliance burden 
faced by the industry.

 Loss of negotiating power and continuity: As more capabilities, technologies and processes are externalised financial institutions will become 
increasingly dependent on 3rd parties for continuity
 Skill loss of workforce: Even though externalising less valuable capabilities will create efficiency, it may result in workforce skill loss over the long
term and employees ability to develop a holistic view of financial services operations
 How will financial institutions participate in capability sharing with other institutions to balance efficiency with control (e.g., utility creation, co-
development, 3rd party providers)?
 How will financial institutions prevent the loss of negotiating power and continuity as the next generation of process externalisation providers are 
often built on managed services models as opposed to today’s vendor models?

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 As the popularity and profitability of high frequency trading declines, the next evolution of algorithmic trading may be dependent on smarter 
machines, allowing a broader class of trades to reap the benefits of automation and sophistication

Future of Smarter Faster Machines 



The proliferation of smarter machines will further shift the focus of machine-based trading to rapidly respond to real-life events
‒
As the race for speed transitions to the development of strategies responding to real-life events, market makers’ trading strategies may 
become more diversified as they access a vast amount of different data sources and infer different market conditions from that data
‒ When trading algorithms become more intelligent by incorporating machine learning, the breadth and accuracy of their analyses will 
expand, and could result in convergence toward a single view of the market
‒ Growing public discontent with algorithmic trading may lead to regulations on the use of automatic data feeds or smart machines in 
executing trades, reverting some parts of market-making activities to manual processes

Key Implications

 The development of smarter, faster machines in algorithmic trading will have varying implications on the market structure in terms of volume, 
liquidity, volatility and spread – the future of algorithmic trading must be approached with a new lens with respect to the benefits it can deliver to the 
ecosystem weighed against the new types of risks it might create

152

Market Provisioning: Smarter, Faster Machines

As the popularity and profitability of high frequency trading declines, the next 
evolution of algorithmic, machine trading remains in question

Overview of algorithmic trading and high frequency trading

 The use of algorithms in trading activities has proliferated in lockstep with the evolution of computing power since its initial application for optimal 
portfolio determination in the 1970s and the emergence of fully automated algorithmic trades in the early 1990s

 Since then, the key focus of algorithmic trading has been on exploiting arbitrage opportunities in time and / or across venues by leveraging low 
latency access to the exchanges (i.e., high-frequency trading, autonomous market makers) and thereby providing liquidity to the market

 These high frequency traders largely replaced the market-making activities traditionally performed by broker dealers, who provided liquidity and 
made prices by manually coordinating offers and taking on the risks of buying and selling shares in return for spread

 While some trading firms and hedge funds use algorithms to achieve faster processing times for analysis of large datasets; price discovery and 
order execution remain the most active areas of high frequency trading

Declining popularity and profitability of high frequency trading

Focus of algorithmic trading by HFTs 

 High frequency trading reached its peak in 2009-2010, where those trades accounted for over 60 percent of all U.S. equities traded in volume

 However, the popularity and profitability of high frequency trading has significantly decreased due to lower volatility, improved liquidity, rising costs 
of trading infrastructure, and regulatory scrutiny

 The development of big data based analyses 
will allow traders to leverage broader and

Summary of impact

As the benefits that can be earned from incremental investments in high 
frequency trading decrease, algorithmic traders will shift their focus to 
real-life events by connecting to new data sources available from social 
media feeds to machine readable news. (1) Due to the vast amount of 
data available, most algorithmic traders will focus on different events and 
triggers. (2) Unlike most high frequency trading strategies, the market 
reaction to real-life events is not certain and traders with different views, 
skills and analytical tools will make different decisions in face of the same 
data. As the result, the trading strategies and tactics of algorithmic traders 
will vastly diversify.

 The focus of a race for speed moves from chasing price movements to 
responding to real-life events through big data analysis and machine 
accessible news
 Market makers’ trading strategies become diversified as they access 
different data sources and infer different market outcomes
 Diversification leads to increase in intraday volatility and wider ask-bid 
spread

Case studies

New innovative services like Dataminr and SNTMNT enable traders to gain access to events and news that 
may trigger market movement (e.g., breaking news, M&A speculation) faster than the competition by utilising 
non-traditional data sources like social media / market sentiment and real-time analytics.
Leveraging these platforms, algorithmic traders can leverage their infrastructure to shift focus from reacting to 
stock price movements to monitoring and reacting to real-life events faster than other traders and investors in 
the market.

Narrative

Summary of impact

As access to a universe of real-time data feeds becomes essential to the 
execution of successful algorithmic trading strategies, the set of data used 
by traders converges with every trader using almost every available data 
source. At the same time algorithms become smarter incorporating 
machine learning and improving the accuracy of projections.
With algorithmic traders connected to similar data sources and smarter 
machines generating similar projections from those data, the variances 
among algorithmic traders’ activities will decrease. 

 Accuracy of market projections by trading algorithms gradually 
improves as market makers gain access to broader sets of big data 
and more sophisticated machines
 Since each market maker’s system accurately predicts the market 
movement, differences among various market makers’ projections and 
trading strategies are eliminated
 As trading strategies converge, volume decreases and arbitrage 
opportunities effectively disappear

Case studies

Ayasdi leverages topological data analysis to process big data sets to unveil patterns within the network of data. In capital
markets, Ayasdi’s technology can be used to understand the relationships between various real-life events and market 
performance to derive trading hypotheses. Over time, additional historical data and trading outcomes can be added back to the
analysed big data to continuously sophisticate and automatically correct the trading hypotheses. 
Neuro Dimension’s TradingSolutions combines technical analysis with artificial intelligence using neural networks and genetic 
algorithms to learn patterns from historical data and optimise system parameters.
As these types of systems become more sophisticated, algorithmic traders will simultaneously predict the market performance 
with a greater degree of accuracy and their trading activities will converge.

Narrative

Summary of impact

The utilisation of new data sources like machine readable news and 
advanced computing in trading activities increases the gap in the level of 
sophistication between professional algorithmic traders and individual, 
retail investors. The public may perceive some of these innovations to be 
an “unfair” advantage; similar to how infrastructures costs associated with 
high frequency trading have been scrutinised. 
Reacting to public sentiment, policy makers and regulatory agencies may 
impose restrictions on what automated data streams and trading 
machines can and cannot be used for various activities. Potential 
misinterpretation of data by smart machines triggering systemic losses 
might accelerate such movements toward regulation.

 Growing public discontent with algorithmic trading leads to regulations 
on the use of automated data feeds and / or smart machines in 
obtaining information or executing trades 
 At least some parts of market-making activities revert to old, manual 
processes, tangibly reducing the trade volume and the liquidity of the 
market
 As a result, the liquidity of the market will decrease. As traders cannot 
react to fact-based price arbitrage as quickly, they may also increase 
their spread to mitigate their risks, resulting in unfavourable price 
formation for both buyers and sellers

Case studies

On 23 April 2013, a false report of explosions at the White House was posted on the hacked Twitter account of Associated 
Press. With many algorithmic traders’ systems linked to key Twitter feeds, algorithmic trades caused a selling spree nearly 
immediately after the posting. As the result, $136 billion was wiped out from the S&P 500 index within two minutes of the 
tweet’s posting. While the market quickly recovered three minutes after the correcting announcement, many industry 
experts and regulatory agencies perceive the event as something that would not have been caused by human traders as 
humans would have second-guessed the validity of the tweet.

What impact will better connected 
buyers and sellers have on capital 
markets?

161

Market Provisioning: Connecting Buyers and Sellers

Executive Summary

Context / Innovation

 Many illiquid financial assets remain highly dependent on intermediating institutions to discover and connect buyers and sellers, often based on 
networks of pre-existing relationships with other institutions 
 However, following the financial crisis, traditional capital market intermediaries’ risk appetite has been reduced while their capital requirements 
increased, limiting their ability to take positions on financial assets to create liquidity; this has resulted in reduced liquidity mainly for non exchange 
traded assets
 Leveraging automation and standardisation of information flow, a number of platforms (information/connection platforms) have emerged with an aim 
to redefine how buyers and sellers are connected in a variety of markets

Future of Market Making / Intermediation

 As these platforms proliferate, the market landscape may change for many financial products and assets
‒ New information/connection platforms will allow demand and supply represented by smaller intermediaries to be more readily and objectively 
discovered by counterparties, Levelling the playing field between them and larger institutions
‒ Alternatively, these platforms could be developed for a “group” of larger institutions to improve connectivity among themselves, reducing their 
need to connect with smaller intermediaries and stabilising the current market framework for existing institutions
‒ Information/connection platforms may also choose to extend the connections to individual investors, acting as a market for specific assets and 
products and opening doors for sellers to easily broaden their buyer base to the broader public

Key Implications

 Improving information flow among market participants through new information/connection platforms will create tangible benefits to the industry by 
empowering intermediating institutions to optimise their ability to make the best decisions for their clients; however, it will also require behaviour 
changes within those institutions

162

Market Provisioning: Connecting Buyers and Sellers

Over-the-counter activities depend on intermediating institutions to discover and 
connect buyers and sellers

How do financial institutions facilitate financial markets liquidity today?

 For a wide range of assets and financial products, financial institutions play a role as an 
intermediary to connect and act on behalf of buyers and sellers
 For some assets (e.g., public stocks, liquid bonds), formal markets exist to facilitate the 
connection between buyers and sellers, typically in the form of exchanges
 For less liquid and less standardised assets and products, demand and supply is often 
dispersed, making direct discovery and connection among buyers and sellers highly 
inefficient
 For these assets and products, financial institutions aggregate demand and supply, and 
build relationships with one another to effectively create a market, the so called over-the-
counter (OTC) market
 As an intermediary, financial institutions sometimes take positions in the assets traded to 
provide liquidity or offer advisory services to the buyers and sellers they represent

Result: When 1 is buying from 3 trade is not executed at

Evolution of OTC driven activities

Key limitations of today’s model

 Over the years, the markets for standardised assets with high 
transaction volume have greatly improved their efficiency by adopting 
technologies to improve connectivity among buyers and sellers
 However, OTC markets still rely on relationship-based intermediaries 
and non standardised processes to connect buyers and sellers
 Since the 2008 financial crisis, increased capital requirements and 
reduced risk appetite among intermediary institutions have limited the 
desirability of acting as a market maker, reducing liquidity for many 
financial assets and products

Operational Inefficiency

Highly manual discovery process 
for the counterparties makes 
transactions time consuming, 
costly and complex

Limited Liquidity

Not all buyers and sellers at a 
given moment are discovered by 
one another, limiting liquidity

Suboptimal Pricing

No intermediaries, regardless of 
their size, have a full view of the 
demand and supply, making the 
best price discovery difficult 

Limited Visibility

Buyers and sellers have imperfect 
visibility into the market supply, 
demand and counterparties, 
limiting their ability to exert control 
over transactions

Limited Access

Buyers’ ability to access assets is limited by their 
intermediaries’ connections with sellers’ intermediaries

163

Market Provisioning: Connecting Buyers and Sellers

New platforms are emerging to connect intermediaries of buyers and sellers to 
facilitate the flow of market information and the discovery of counterparties

What are the new platforms?

 Leveraging technological innovations, a number of platforms have emerged 
to redefine how buyers and sellers are connected for various financial assets 
and products, improving the efficiency of those markets
 These platforms automate and standardise collection of demand / supply 
data from intermediaries or buyers and sellers to create an aggregated view 
of the market and facilitate discovery of the most suitable counterparties
 Some platforms provide additional analyses on the data collected to better 
inform buyers / sellers and their intermediaries in choosing their 
counterparties

Key Characteristics

Advantages

Shortcomings

 Information about buyers and sellers (e.g., current 
inventory / demand, historical performance) is distributed 
via relationships / awareness existing among their 
intermediaries
 Intermediaries collect, analyse and act on the information 
about the counterparties and the market

 Reduced chance of counterparty failure by transacting 
through established, trusted intermediary relationships
 Reduced exposure to arbitrage attempts as demand and 
supply is only visible to a small number of intermediaries

 Highly manual, relationship-based discovery and 
assessment of demand and supply leading to inefficiency
 Potential to overlook the best price available due to the 
limitation in the scale of each intermediary’s network
 Limited visibility of the transaction process to buyers and 
sellers

 Intermediaries of buyers and sellers in some cases, are 
directly discovered and connected via a central platform
 Information on counterparties and the market is 
aggregated and analysed by the central platform for all 
constituents in the market

 More efficient discovery and assessment of demand and 
supply in the market leading to more accurate price 
formation
 Reduced need for financial institutions to take position in 
assets and products to generate liquidity
 Increased visibility and control over transactions by buyers 
and sellers

 Need to balance adequate price formation with potential 
price discovery and arbitrage attempts
 Potential counterparty risks when dealing with 
intermediaries (or buyers / sellers) without an established 
relationship or reputation

Market Provisioning: Connecting Buyers and Sellers

As buyers, sellers and intermediaries become better connected via these 
platforms, the overall efficiency of the market will improve

Key characteristics of the future markets enabled by improved market connections

Increased Liquidity

More intermediaries, and buyers and sellers, 
will be connected with one another to enable 
more accurate assessment of demand and 
supply in the market, leading to improved 
liquidity in the market 

Improved Price Accuracy

As the aggregate demand and supply can be 
assessed more accurately, intermediaries 
and buyers / sellers will be able to determine 
the best price more accurately without 
revealing undesired information to the market

Transparency

Buyers and sellers will gain more visibility 
into the transaction process and therefore 
will be able to exert greater control over the 
transactions and reduce the opportunities for 
suboptimal transactions by intermediaries 
(e.g., agent conflict of interest)

Improved Access

The ability to buy / sell financial assets and 
products will be less dependent on the scale 
or the size of the intermediaries' network, 
improving access to the market by more 
buyers, sellers, and intermediaries

Faster, Cheaper Transactions

As the discovery and assessment of 
counterparties become more streamlined 
and automated, the efficiency of 
intermediaries will improve, leading to faster 
turnaround and lower cost to complete 
transactions for buyers and sellers

How will the market landscape change for various financial assets and products as buyers and 
sellers are better connected in the future?

 Unlike relationship-driven market making, 
where larger institutions have an advantage 
over smaller institutions, new platforms will 
allow demand and supply represented by 

smaller institutions to be more readily 

discovered by counterparties
 These platforms will also provide fact-
based measures to make counterparty 
comparison and selection to be more 
objective, enabling smaller institutions with 
less developed networks of relationships to 
compete

 Platforms are developed and used by larger 
institutions to improve connectivity and 

efficiency among a “group” of large 
players

 As connections among larger intermediaries 
are strengthened by information/connection 
platforms, the need for larger institutions to 
connect with smaller intermediaries to 
generate liquidity will decrease, effectively 
building barriers of entry for smaller, 
newer institutions

 As platforms grow, they may choose to 

extend connections to individual 

investors (e.g., acting as brokerages)
 When sufficient volume from individual 
investors can be aggregated, these 
platforms can act as a market for specific 

assets and products and open doors for 

sellers to easily broaden their buyer base to 
the broader public

question above – they are not meant to be future predictions
 These scenarios are illustrations of particular aspects of the potential future and are not meant to represent a complete view of the market and 
competitive landscape – in many cases, some or all scenarios could be realised at the same time

Narrative

Summary of impact

Market information / connection platforms open their doors to 
intermediating institutions of all sizes. Smaller institutions are particularly 
incentivised to join such platforms as the platforms significantly expand 
the intermediaries’ access to market information and connect them to a 
universe of potential counterparties.
As these platforms grow in scale, so will the pressure for greater trade 
transparency and the use of more quantitative metrics for best execution. 
As large intermediaries yield to client pressure to adopt these metrics, 
they will be more likely to interact with smaller intermediaries with whom 
they may not have previously established working relationships.

 Standardised platforms facilitate connections between large and small 
intermediating institutions to help them find counterparties; 
considerably expanding the number of trading options for smaller 
intermediaries, whose ability to connect with other institutions was 
previously limited by scale
 These platforms provide fact-based measures to improve the 
objectivity of counterparty comparison and selection, enabling smaller 
intermediaries to compete based on the interests of their clients and 
their merits, instead of scale and reputation

Case studies

Novus is a portfolio intelligence platform that automatically gathers and analyses data on various funds’ performance to 
provide visibility and transparency to fund-of-funds managers. Traditionally, fund-of-funds managers discovered and 
researched investment opportunities manually by contacting target funds. As a result, the ability of fund-of-funds to 
source investment opportunities was dependent on their scale, reputation and network. Through Novus’ automated 
platform, nearly all funds operating across the world and their performance are catalogued and analysed based on an 
automated collection of regulatory reporting data. This allows smaller fund-of-funds to independently identify lucrative 
investment opportunities without being limited by their reputation and the size of their networks.

Scenario 1: Levelling the playing field for newer, smaller institutions (2 / 2)

Necessary conditions for the scenario

Implications of the scenario on…

 Top-level and line-level buy-in from large and small institutions for 
adopting the information/connection platforms
 Intermediating institutions’ are comfortable with managing the risks 
associated with transacting with less familiar, less pre-defined 
counterparties 

Clients

 Higher chance of achieving the best execution of 
trades
 Customers’ ability to achieve optimal results is no longer 
constricted by the size of their intermediaries 
 Sources liquidity from the broadest group of counterparties 
without risking discovery of demand / supply

Incumbents

 Traders are required to adapt to new behaviours
 Need to establish new processes to support the new 
business model (in particular small institutions who might 
need to improve their transparency and best execution 
policies) 

Overall 
Ecosystem

 Supports diversification of counterparties based on 
asset specialisation

Opportunities and risks associated with the scenario

Opportunities

Risks

 Incentivise deeper specialisation of intermediaries by creating higher 
returns to specialization
 Potential increase in systemic resilience as the result of diversification 
of related parties

 Transparency of counterparty selection is dependent on the 
transparency of the information/connection platforms
 Increased counterparty risks when dealing with newer, smaller 
counterparties without standing reputation or relationships

Narrative

Summary of impact

As standardised information/connection platforms gain popularity, a 
“group” of large intermediaries may explore adopting the techniques 
behind these platforms to create a streamlined, exclusive network among 
themselves. These large institutions may acquire or partner with 
standardised platforms to set up artificial barriers against smaller and 
newer institutions.
As these exclusive networks grow, it will become more difficult for smaller 
institutions to find trading counterparties or compete with the efficiency 
delivered by those networks. 

 As connections among larger intermediaries are strengthened by 
platforms, the need for larger institutions to connect with smaller 
intermediaries may decrease, effectively building barriers of entry for 
smaller, newer institutions
 Smaller companies lack economies of scale to set up their own liquidity 
network and may lose their customers to the larger institutions

170

Market Provisioning: Connecting Buyers and Sellers

Scenario 2: Stabilising market framework for existing institutions (2 / 2)

Necessary conditions for the scenario

Implications of the scenario on…

 Regulatory tolerance of exclusive networks (e.g., no collusion or 
anti-trust concerns)
 Large institutions participating in exclusive networks do not 
experience significant loss in liquidity by excluding smaller 
institutions
 Continued customer confidence in large institutions to fulfill their 
orders at a reasonably fair price

Clients

 Liquidity may increase relative to the current state, 
but could be less than under an open platform 

Incumbents

 Large institutions retain strategic advantages over 
smaller institutions

Overall 
Ecosystem

 Increased concentration of trades among a small 
number of intermediaries
 Increased difficulty for small intermediaries to 
compete outside of niche specialties
 Creates barriers of entry for new intermediaries

Narrative

Summary of impact

Under the current market structure individual investors cannot directly 
participate in markets for many assets because information about supply 
and demand is disparate and disorganised. As the growth of 
information/connection platforms improves visibility into these asset 
classes, the platforms may choose to expand their offerings to provide 
access for qualified individual investors. 
Using these platforms, individual investors are able to transact directly 
with one another or can aggregate their demand/supply to interact with 
institutional investors. As engagement with individual investors grows, 
some platforms may choose to evolve to play the role of a broker.

 As platforms grow, they choose to extend their connections to 
individual investors, enabling them to bypass traditional intermediaries 
and transact with one another
 These information/connection platforms may help individual investors 
represent their aggregate demand and supply more effectively to 
institutional buyers and sellers 
 If sufficient volume can be aggregated from individual investors, these 
platforms can effectively act as a market for specific assets and 
products, and open doors for sellers to broaden their buyer base

Case studies

Liquity provides private company directors with a comprehensive suite of shareholder and equity management services 
and match investors with private company shareholders who want to sell some or all of their equity. Liquity facilitates 
complete deals, from introduction to transaction completion including escrow and custodial services.

 Impetus for intermediaries to strengthen values they 
provide to clients beyond transaction facilitation

 Increased liquidity on standardised platforms

Opportunities and risks associated with the scenario

Opportunities

Risks

 Opportunities to separate transactional services from high-value, 
advisory offerings
 Opportunities to engage new buyers and sellers in the market, 
increasing liquidity and diversifying the needs and opinions of market 
participants

lack of specialised knowledge (relative to professional intermediaries)
 Increased burden on regulatory agencies as more parties are directly 
involved in the market

What does this mean for financial institutions?

Key implications and remaining questions

“Safe Bets” – Likely implications under all scenarios

!

!

 Less differentiation among intermediaries: As the ability to fulfill the transaction needs of customers become commoditised by market 
connection platforms, financial intermediaries will be less differentiated by their capabilities
 Redistributed negotiating power: With both counterparties and their intermediaries gaining improved visibility into market demand and supply, 
negotiating power will be redistributed based on actual demand and supply resulting in more efficient pricing
 Shift to advisory models: As the financial intermediaries’ role in counterparty discovery and negotiation diminishes, their ability to build customer 
relationships based on advice will become more important to their competitiveness
 How will financial intermediaries differentiate from one another as improved information flow and trading connections reduce the gaps in institutions’ 
ability to find counterparties for their customers?

fulfilling transactions falls, the fee structure 
of intermediation services, as well as actual

institutions: Established intermediaries will 
become more active in investing, 
implementing, and acquiring market 
connection platforms to stablise the current 
market framework
 How will established intermediaries gain 
exclusive access to market connection 
platforms while avoiding conflict-of-interest 
(i.e., best execution) and anti-trust issues?

?

!

 Reduced value proposition to 
institutional customers: As some 

institutional customers choose to directly 
discover and transact with counterparties 
via market connection platforms, their 
stickiness on other institutional services, 
such as asset management and investment 
banking, may decrease
 What additional value will financial 
intermediaries provide high net worth 
individuals to prevent the erosion of their 
businesses by direct access to 
counterparties via market connection 
platforms?
